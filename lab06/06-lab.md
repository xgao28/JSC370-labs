Lab 06 - Regular Expressions and Web Scraping
================
Xinxiang Gao

``` r
library(httr)
library(xml2)
library(stringr)
library(kableExtra)
```

# Learning goals

- Use a real world API to make queries and process the data.
- Use regular expressions to parse the information.
- Practice your GitHub skills.

# Lab description

In this lab, we will be working with the [NCBI
API](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/home/develop/api/) to make queries and
extract information using XML and regular expressions. For this lab, we
will be using the `httr`, `xml2`, and `stringr` R packages.

This markdown document should be rendered using `github_document`
document ONLY and pushed to your *JSC370-labs* repository in
`lab06/README.md`.

## Question 1: How many sars-cov-2 papers?

Build an automatic counter of sars-cov-2 papers using PubMed. You will
need to apply XPath as we did during the lecture to extract the number
of results returned by PubMed in the following web address:

    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=sars-cov-2

Complete the lines of code:

``` r
# Downloading the website
website <- xml2::read_html("https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=sars-cov-2")

# Finding the counts
counts <- xml2::xml_find_first(website, "//span[@class='value']")

# Turning it into text
counts <- as.character(counts)

# Extracting the data using regex
stringr::str_extract(counts, "[0-9,]{7}")
```

    ## [1] "218,712"

- How many sars-cov-2 papers are there?

*<span class="value">218,712</span>*

Don’t forget to commit your work!

## Question 2: Academic publications on COVID19 related to Toronto

Use the function `httr::GET()` to make the following query:

1.  Baseline URL:
    <https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi>

2.  Query parameters:

    - db: pubmed
    - term: covid19 toronto
    - retmax: 300

The parameters passed to the query are documented
[here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25499/).

``` r
library(httr)
query_ids <- GET(
  url   = "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi",
  query = list("db" = "pubmed",
    "term" = "covid19 toronto",
    "retmax" = 300)
)

# Extracting the content of the response of GET
ids <- httr::content(query_ids)
```

The query will return an XML object, we can turn it into a character
list to analyze the text directly with `as.character()`. Another way of
processing the data could be using lists with the function
`xml2::as_list()`. We will skip the latter for now.

Take a look at the data, and continue with the next question (don’t
forget to commit and push your results to your GitHub repo!).

## Question 3: Get details about the articles

The Ids are wrapped around text in the following way:
`<Id>... id number ...</Id>`. we can use a regular expression that
extract that information. Fill out the following lines of code:

``` r
# Turn the result into a character vector
ids <- as.character(ids)

# Find all the ids 
ids <- stringr::str_extract_all(ids, "<Id>[0-9]+</Id>")[[1]]

# Remove all the leading and trailing <Id> </Id>. Make use of "|"
ids <- stringr::str_remove_all(ids, "<Id>|</Id>")
```

With the ids in hand, we can now try to get the abstracts of the papers.
As before, we will need to coerce the contents (results) to a list
using:

1.  Baseline url:
    <https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi>

2.  Query parameters:

    - db: pubmed
    - id: A character with all the ids separated by comma, e.g.,
      “1232131,546464,13131”
    - retmax: 300
    - rettype: abstract

**Pro-tip**: If you want `GET()` to take some element literal, wrap it
around `I()` (as you would do in a formula in R). For example, the text
`"123,456"` is replaced with `"123%2C456"`. If you don’t want that
behavior, you would need to do the following `I("123,456")`.

``` r
publications <- GET(
  url   = "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi",
  query = list(
  "db" = "pubmed",
  "id" = paste(ids, collapse = ","),
  "retmax" = 300,
  "rettype" = "abstract"
)
)

# Turning the output into character vector
publications <- httr::content(publications)
publications_txt <- as.character(publications)
```

With this in hand, we can now analyze the data. This is also a good time
for committing and pushing your work!

## Question 4: Distribution of universities, schools, and departments

Using the function `stringr::str_extract_all()` applied on
`publications_txt`, capture all the terms of the form:

1.  University of …
2.  … Institute of …

Write a regular expression that captures all such instances

``` r
institution <- str_extract_all(
  publications_txt,
  "\\bUniversity of \\w+|\\w+ Institute of \\w+"
  ) 
institution <- unlist(institution)
kableExtra::scroll_box(knitr::kable(as.data.frame(table(institution))), width = "800px", height = "400px")
```

<div style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 0px; overflow-y: scroll; height:400px; overflow-x: scroll; width:800px; ">

## Question 5: Form a database

We want to build a dataset which includes the title and the abstract of
the paper. The title of all records is enclosed by the HTML tag
`ArticleTitle`, and the abstract by `AbstractText`.

Before applying the functions to extract text directly, it will help to
process the XML a bit. We will use the `xml2::xml_children()` function
to keep one element per id. This way, if a paper is missing the
abstract, or something else, we will be able to properly match PUBMED
IDS with their corresponding records.

``` r
pub_char_list <- xml2::xml_children(publications)
pub_char_list <- sapply(pub_char_list, as.character)
```

Now, extract the abstract and article title for each one of the elements
of `pub_char_list`. You can either use `sapply()` as we just did, or
simply take advantage of vectorization of `stringr::str_extract`

``` r
abstracts <- str_extract(pub_char_list, "<AbstractText>.+?</AbstractText>")

# Remove HTML tags
abstracts <- str_remove_all(abstracts, "<.*?>")

# Remove extra white space and new lines
abstracts <- str_replace_all(abstracts, "\\s+", " ")
# alternatively, you can also use str_replace_all(abstracts, "[ORIGINAL]", "[REPLACEMENT]")
na_abs_count <- sum(is.na(abstracts))
```

- How many of these don’t have an abstract?

189

Now, the title

``` r
titles <- str_extract(pub_char_list, "<ArticleTitle>.+?</ArticleTitle>")

# Remove HTML tags
titles <- str_remove_all(titles, "<.*?>")

# Remove extra white space and new lines
titles <- str_replace_all(titles, "\\s+", " ")

na_title_count <- sum(is.na(titles))
```

- How many of these don’t have a title ?

0

Finally, put everything together into a single `data.frame` and use
`knitr::kable` to print the results

``` r
database <- data.frame(
    ids = ids,
    Title = titles,
    Abstract = abstracts
)
kableExtra::scroll_box(knitr::kable(database), width = "800px", height = "400px")
```

Sex differences in plasma proteomic markers in late-life depression.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Previous studies have shown significant sex-specific differences in
major depressive disorder (MDD) in multiple biological parameters. Most
studies focused on young and middle-aged adults, and there is a paucity
of information about sex-specific biological differences in older adults
with depression (aka, late-life depression (LLD)). To address this gap,
this study aimed to evaluate sex-specific biological abnormalities in a
large group of individuals with LLD using an untargeted proteomic
analysis. We quantified 344 plasma proteins using a multiplex assay in
430 individuals with LLD and 140 healthy comparisons (HC) (age range
between 60 and 85 years old for both groups). Sixty-six signaling
proteins were differentially expressed in LLD (both sexes). Thirty-three
proteins were uniquely associated with LLD in females, while six
proteins were uniquely associated with LLD in males. The main biological
processes affected by these proteins in females were related to
immunoinflammatory control. In contrast, despite the smaller number of
associated proteins, males showed dysregulations in a broader range of
biological pathways, including immune regulation pathways, cell cycle
control, and metabolic control. Sex has a significant impact on
biomarker changes in LLD. Despite some overlap in differentially
expressed biomarkers, males and females show different patterns of
biomarkers changes, and males with LLD exhibit abnormalities in a larger
set of biological processes compared to females. Our findings can
provide novel targets for sex-specific interventions in LLD.

Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on sleep parameters and characteristics in
individuals living with overweight and obesity.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been very challenging for those
living with overweight and obesity. The magnitude of this impact on
sleep requires further attention to optimise patient care and outcomes.
This study assessed the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on sleep
duration and quality as well as identify predictors of poor sleep
quality in individuals with reported diagnoses of obstructive sleep
apnoea and those without sleep apnoea. An online survey (June-October
2020) was conducted with two samples; one representative of Canadians
living with overweight and obesity (n = 1089) and a second of
individuals recruited through obesity clinical services or patient
organisations (n = 980). While overall sleep duration did not decline
much, there were identifiable groups with reduced or increased sleep.
Those with changed sleep habits, especially reduced sleep, had much
poorer sleep quality, were younger, gained more weight and were more
likely to be female. Poor sleep quality was associated with medical,
social and eating concerns as well as mood disturbance. Those with sleep
apnoea had poorer quality sleep although this was offset to some degree
by use of CPAP. Sleep quality and quantity has been significantly
impacted during the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic in those living
with overweight and obesity. Predictors of poor sleep and the impact of
sleep apnoea with and without CPAP therapy on sleep parameters has been
evaluated. Identifying those at increased risk of sleep alterations and
its impact requires further clinical consideration.

The Intersections of COVID-19 Global Health Governance and Population
Health Priorities: Equity-Related Lessons Learned From Canada and
Selected G20 Countries.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Background: COVID-19-related global health governance (GHG) processes
and public health measures taken influenced population health priorities
worldwide. We investigated the intersection between COVID-19-related GHG
and how it redefined population health priorities in Canada and other
G20 countries. We analysed a Canada-related multilevel qualitative study
and a scoping review of selected G20 countries. Findings show the
importance of linking equity considerations to funding and
accountability when responding to COVID-19. Nationalism and limited
coordination among governance actors contributed to fragmented COVID-19
public health responses. COVID-19-related consequences were not
systematically negative, but when they were, they affected more
population groups living and working in conditions of vulnerability and
marginalisation. Policy options and recommendations: Six policy options
are proposed addressing upstream determinants of health, such as
providing sufficient funding for equitable and accountable global and
public health outcomes and implementing gender-focused policies to
reduce COVID-19 response-related inequities and negative consequences
downstream. Specific programmatic (e.g., assessing the needs of the
community early) and research recommendations are also suggested to
redress identified gaps. Conclusion: Despite the consequences of the
COVID-19 pandemic, programmatic and research opportunities along with
concrete policy options must be mobilised and implemented without
further delay. We collectively share the duty to act upon global health
justice.

“Going vaccine hunting”: Multilevel influences on COVID-19 vaccination
among racialized sexual and gender minority adults-a qualitative study.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
High levels of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy have been reported among Black
and Latinx populations, with lower vaccination coverage among racialized
versus White sexual and gender minorities. We examined multilevel
contexts that influence COVID-19 vaccine uptake, barriers to
vaccination, and vaccine hesitancy among predominantly racialized sexual
and gender minority individuals. Semi-structured online interviews
explored perspectives and experiences around COVID-19 vaccination.
Interviews were recorded, transcribed, uploaded into ATLAS.ti, and
reviewed using thematic analysis. Among 40 participants (mean age, 29.0
years \[SD, 9.6\]), all identified as sexual and/or gender minority,
82.5% of whom were racialized. COVID-19 vaccination experiences were
dominated by structural barriers: systemic racism, transphobia and
homophobia in healthcare and government/public health institutions;
limited availability of vaccination/appointments in vulnerable
neighborhoods; absence of culturally-tailored and multi-language
information; lack of digital/internet access; and prohibitive indirect
costs of vaccination. Vaccine hesitancy reflected in uncertainties about
a novel vaccine amid conflicting information and institutional mistrust
was integrally linked to structural factors. Findings suggest that the
uncritical application of “vaccine hesitancy” to unilaterally explain
undervaccination among marginalized populations risks conflating
structural and institutional barriers with individual-level
psychological factors, in effect placing the onus on those most
disenfranchised to overcome societal and institutional processes of
marginalization. Rather, disaggregating structural determinants of
vaccination availability, access, and institutional stigma and mistrust
from individual attitudes and decision-making that reflect vaccine
hesitancy, may support 1) evidence-informed interventions to mitigate
structural barriers in access to vaccination, and 2) culturally-informed
approaches to address decisional ambivalence in the context of
structural homophobia, transphobia, and racism.

Aerosol Generating Procedures and Associated Control/Mitigation
Measures: A position paper from the Canadian Dental Hygienists
Association and the American Dental Hygienists’ Association.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Background Since the outbreak of COVID-19, how to reduce the risk of
spreading viruses and other microorganisms while performing aerosol
generating procedures (AGPs) has become a challenging question within
the dental and dental hygiene communities. The purpose of this position
paper is to summarize the existing evidence about the effectiveness of
various mitigation methods used to reduce the risk of infection
transmission during AGPs in dentistry.Methods The authors searched six
databases, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library,
and Google Scholar, for relevant scientific evidence published in the
last ten years (January 2012 to December 2022) to answer six research
questions about the the aspects of risk of transmission, methods,
devices, and personal protective equipment (PPE) used to reduce contact
with microbial pathogens and limit the spread of aerosols.Results A
total of 78 studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria. There was
limited literature to indicate the risk of infection transmission of
SARS-CoV-2 between dental hygienists and their patients. A number of
mouthrinses are effective in reducing bacterial contaminations in
aerosols; however, their effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 was limited.
The combined use of eyewear, masks, and face shields are effective for
the prevention of contamination of the facial and nasal region, while
performing AGPs. High volume evacuation with or without an intraoral
suction, low volume evacuation, saliva ejector, and rubber dam (when
appropriate) have shown effectiveness in reducing aerosol transmission
beyond the generation site. Finally, the appropriate combination of
ventilation and filtration in dental operatories are effective in
limiting the spread of aerosols.Conclusion Aerosols produced during
clinical procedures can potentially pose a risk of infection
transmission between dental hygienists and their patients. The
implementation of practices supported by available evidence are best
practices to ensure patient and provider safety in oral health settings.
More studies in dental clinical environment would shape future practices
and protocols, ultimately to ensure safe clinical care delivery.

Pandemic: Perspectives of Residents, Families, and Staff.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
In Canada, long-term care and retirement home residents have experienced
high rates of COVID-19 infection and death. Early efforts to protect
residents included restricting all visitors as well as movement inside
homes. These restrictions, however, had significant implications for
residents’ health and well-being. Engaging with those most affected by
such restrictions can help us to better understand their experiences and
address their needs. In this qualitative study, 43 residents of
long-term care or retirement homes, family members and staff were
interviewed and offered recommendations related to infection control,
communication, social contact and connection, care needs, and policy and
planning. The recommendations were examined using an ethical framework,
providing potential relevance in policy development for public health
crises. Our results highlight the harms of movement and visiting
restrictions and call for effective, equitable, and transparent
measures. The design of long-term care and retirement policies requires
ongoing, meaningful engagement with those most affected.

RéSUMé: CONTEXTE: Les soins virtuels au Canada ont rapidement pris de
l’ampleur pendant la pandémie de COVID-19 dans un environnement où les
règles sont peu strictes, en réponse aux besoins urgents d’accès continu
aux soins dans un contexte de restrictions en santé publique. Les
spécialistes de la médecine d’urgence sont maintenant confrontés au défi
de conseiller sur les services de soins d’urgence virtuels qui devraient
rester dans le cadre des soins d’urgence complets. Il faut tenir compte
des soins sécuritaires, de qualité et appropriés, ainsi que des
questions d’accès équitable, de la demande publique et de la durabilité
(financière et autre). L’objectif de ce projet était de résumer la
littérature actuelle et l’opinion d’experts et de formuler des
recommandations sur la voie à suivre pour les soins virtuels en médecine
d’urgence. MéTHODES: Nous avons formé un groupe de travail composé de
médecins urgentistes de partout au Canada qui travaillent dans divers
milieux de pratique. Le groupe de travail sur les soins virtuels a
effectué un examen de la portée de la documentation et s’est réuni
chaque mois pour discuter des thèmes et formuler des recommandations.
Les recommandations finales ont été distribuées aux intervenants pour
obtenir leurs commentaires, puis présentées au symposium universitaire
2023 de l’Association canadienne des médecins d’urgence (ACMU) pour
discussion, rétroaction et perfectionnement. RéSULTATS: Le groupe de
travail a élaboré et atteint l’unanimité sur neuf recommandations
portant sur les thèmes de la conception du système, de l’équité et de
l’accessibilité, de la qualité et de la sécurité des patients, de
l’éducation et des programmes, des modèles financiers et de la viabilité
des services virtuels de soins d’urgence au Canada. CONCLUSION : Les
soins d’urgence virtuels sont devenus un service établi dans le système
de santé canadien. Les spécialistes en médecine d’urgence sont
particulièrement bien placés pour fournir un leadership et des conseils
sur la prestation optimale de ces services afin d’améliorer et de
compléter les soins d’urgence au Canada.

The independent and combined impact of moral injury and moral distress
on post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms among healthcare workers
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) across the globe have reported
symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) during the COVID-19
pandemic. Moral Injury (MI) has been associated with PTSD in military
populations, but is not well studied in healthcare contexts. Moral
Distress (MD), a related concept, may enhance understandings of MI and
its relation to PTSD among HCWs. This study examined the independent and
combined impact of MI and MD on PTSD symptoms in Canadian HCWs during
the pandemic.Methods: HCWs participated in an online survey between
February and December 2021, with questions regarding sociodemographics,
mental health and trauma history (e.g. MI, MD, PTSD, dissociation,
depression, anxiety, stress, childhood adversity). Structural equation
modelling was used to analyze the independent and combined impact of MI
and MD on PTSD symptoms (including dissociation) among the sample when
controlling for sex, age, depression, anxiety, stress, and childhood
adversity.Results: A structural equation model independently regressing
both MI and MD onto PTSD accounted for 74.4% of the variance in PTSD
symptoms. Here, MI was strongly and significantly associated with PTSD
symptoms (β = .412, p &lt; .0001) to a higher degree than MD (β = .187,
p &lt; .0001), after controlling for age, sex, depression, anxiety,
stress and childhood adversity. A model regressing a combined MD and MI
construct onto PTSD predicted approximately 87% of the variance in PTSD
symptoms (r2 = .87, p &lt; .0001), with MD/MI strongly and significantly
associated with PTSD (β = .813, p &lt; .0001), after controlling for
age, sex, depression, anxiety, stress, and childhood
adversity.Conclusion: Our results support a relation between MI and PTSD
among HCWs and suggest that a combined MD and MI construct is most
strongly associated with PTSD symptoms. Further research is needed
better understand the mechanisms through which MD/MI are associated with
PTSD.

Exposure to moral stressors and associated outcomes in healthcare
workers: prevalence, correlates, and impact on job attrition.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Introduction: Healthcare workers (HCWs) often experience morally
challenging situations in their workplaces that may contribute to job
turnover and compromised well-being. This study aimed to characterize
the nature and frequency of moral stressors experienced by HCWs during
the COVID-19 pandemic, examine their influence on psychosocial-spiritual
factors, and capture the impact of such factors and related moral
stressors on HCWs’ self-reported job attrition intentions.Methods: A
sample of 1204 Canadian HCWs were included in the analysis through a
web-based survey platform whereby work-related factors (e.g. years spent
working as HCW, providing care to COVID-19 patients), moral distress
(captured by MMD-HP), moral injury (captured by MIOS), mental health
symptomatology, and job turnover due to moral distress were
assessed.Results: Moral stressors with the highest reported frequency
and distress ratings included patient care requirements that exceeded
the capacity HCWs felt safe/comfortable managing, reported lack of
resource availability, and belief that administration was not addressing
issues that compromised patient care. Participants who considered
leaving their jobs (44%; N = 517) demonstrated greater moral distress
and injury scores. Logistic regression highlighted burnout (AOR = 1.59;
p &lt; .001), moral distress (AOR = 1.83; p &lt; .001), and moral injury
due to trust violation (AOR = 1.30; p = .022) as significant predictors
of the intention to leave one’s job.Conclusion: While it is impossible
to fully eliminate moral stressors from healthcare, especially during
exceptional and critical scenarios like a global pandemic, it is crucial
to recognize the detrimental impacts on HCWs. This underscores the
urgent need for additional research to identify protective factors that
can mitigate the impact of these stressors.

A longitudinal study examining the associations between prenatal and
postnatal maternal distress and toddler socioemotional developmental
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Elevated psychological distress, experienced by pregnant women and
parents, has been well-documented during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most
research focuses on the first 6-months postpartum, with single or
limited repeated measures of perinatal distress. The present
longitudinal study examined how perinatal distress, experienced over
nearly 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic, impacted toddler socioemotional
development. A sample of 304 participants participated during pregnancy,
6-weeks, 6-months, and 15-months postpartum. Mothers reported their
depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms, at each timepoint.
Mother-reported toddler socioemotional functioning (using the Brief
Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment) was measured at
15-months. Results of structural equation mediation models indicated
that (1) higher prenatal distress was associated with elevated
postpartum distress, from 6-weeks to 15-months postpartum; (2)
associations between prenatal distress and toddler socioemotional
problems became nonsignificant after accounting for postpartum distress;
and (3) higher prenatal distress was indirectly associated with greater
socioemotional problems, and specifically elevated externalizing
problems, through higher maternal distress at 6 weeks and 15 months
postpartum. Findings suggest that the continued experience of distress
during the postpartum period plays an important role in child
socioemotional development during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Flashbulb memories (FBMs) refer to vivid and long-lasting
autobiographical memories for the circumstances in which people learned
of a shocking and consequential public event. A cross-national study
across eleven countries aimed to investigate FBM formation following the
first COVID-19 case news in each country and test the effect of
pandemic-related variables on FBM. Participants had detailed memories of
the date and others present when they heard the news, and had partially
detailed memories of the place, activity, and news source. China had the
highest FBM specificity. All countries considered the COVID-19 emergency
as highly significant at both the individual and global level. The
Classification and Regression Tree Analysis revealed that FBM
specificity might be influenced by participants’ age, subjective
severity (assessment of COVID-19 impact in each country and relative to
others), residing in an area with stringent COVID-19 protection
measures, and expecting the pandemic effects. Hierarchical regression
models demonstrated that age and subjective severity negatively
predicted FBM specificity, whereas sex, pandemic impact expectedness,
and rehearsal showed positive associations in the total sample.
Subjective severity negatively affected FBM specificity in Turkey,
whereas pandemic impact expectedness positively influenced FBM
specificity in China and negatively in Denmark.

What might working from home mean for the geography of work and
commuting in the Greater Golden Horseshoe, Canada?
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the precarity of urban society,
illustrating both opportunities and challenges. Teleworking rates
increased dramatically during the pandemic and may be sustained over the
long term. For transportation planners, these changes belie the broader
questions of how the geography of work and commuting will change based
on pandemic-induced shifts in teleworking and what this will mean for
society and policymaking. This study focuses on these questions by using
survey data (n = 2580) gathered in the autumn of 2021 to explore the
geography of current and prospective telework. The study focuses on the
Greater Golden Horseshoe, the mega-region in Southern Ontario,
representing a fifth of Canadians. Survey data document telework
practices before and during the pandemic, including prospective future
telework practices. Inferential models are used to develop
working-from-home scenarios which are allocated spatially based on
respondents’ locations of work and residence. Findings indicate that
telework appears to be poised to increase most relative to pre-pandemic
levels around downtown Toronto based on locations of work, but increases
in teleworking are more dispersed based on employees’ locations of
residence. Contrary to expectations by many, teleworking is not
significantly linked to home-work disconnect - suggesting that telework
is poised to weaken the commute-housing trade-off embedded in bid rent
theory. Together, these results portend a poor outlook for downtown
urban agglomeration economies but also more nuanced impacts than simply
inducing sprawl.

Physical activity and unexpected weight change in Ontario children and

Ontario Parent Survey 2.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
The objective of this study was to investigate the association between
children’s parent-reported physical activity levels and weight changes
during the COVID-19 pandemic among children and youth in Ontario Canada.
A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in parents of children
5-17 years living in Ontario from May to July 2021. Parents recalled
their child’s physical activity and weight change during the year prior
to their completion of the survey. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence
intervals (CI) were estimated using multinomial logistic regression for
the association between physical activity and weight gain or loss,
adjusted for child age and gender, parent ethnicity, current housing
type, method of school delivery, and financial stability. Overall, 86.8%
of children did not obtain 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical
activity per day and 75.4% of parents were somewhat or very concerned
about their child’s physical activity levels. For all physical activity
exposures (outdoor play, light physical activity, and
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity), lower physical activity was
consistently associated with increased odds of weight gain or loss. For
example, the adjusted OR for the association between 0-1 days of
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity versus 6-7 days and child weight
gain was 5.81 (95% CI 4.47, 7.56). Parent concern about their child’s
physical activity was also strongly associated with child weight gain
(OR 7.29; 95% CI 5.94, 8.94). No differences were observed between boys
and girls. This study concludes that a high proportion of children in
Ontario had low physical activity levels during the COVID-19 pandemic
and that low physical activity was strongly associated with parent
reports of both weight gain and loss among children.

The Efficacy and Safety of Nafamostat Mesylate in the Treatment of

Nafamostat mesylate, a synthetic serine protease inhibitor, has
demonstrated early antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and
anticoagulant properties that may be beneficial in COVID-19. We
conducted a meta-analysis evaluating the efficacy and safety of
nafamostat mesylate for COVID-19 treatment. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane
Library, Scopus, Web of Science, medRxiv and bioRxiv were searched up to
July 2023 for studies comparing outcomes between nafamostat mesylate
treatment and no nafamostat mesylate treatment in COVID-19 patients.
Mortality, disease progression and adverse events were analyzed. Six
studies involving 16,195 patients were included. Meta-analysis revealed
no significant difference in mortality (OR=0.88, 95%CI: 0.20-3.75,
P=0.86) or disease progression (OR=2.76, 95%CI: 0.31-24.68, P=0.36)
between groups. However, nafamostat mesylate was associated with
increased hyperkalemia risk (OR=7.15, 95%CI: 2.66 to 19.24,
P&lt;0.0001). Nafamostat mesylate does not improve mortality or
morbidity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared to no nafamostat
mesylate treatment. The significant hyperkalemia risk is a serious
concern requiring monitoring and preventative measures. Further research
is needed in different COVID-19 populations.

How did European countries set health priorities in response to the

</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
The COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments across the world to
consider how to prioritise the allocation of scarce resources. There are
many tools and frameworks that have been designed to assist with the
challenges of priority setting in health care. The purpose of this study
was to examine the extent to which formal priority setting was evident
in the pandemic plans produced by countries in the World Health
Organisation’s EURO region, during the first wave of the COVID-19
pandemic. This compliments analysis of similar plans produced in other
regions of the world. Twenty four pandemic preparedness plans were
obtained that had been published between March and September 2020. For
data extraction, we applied a framework for identifying and assessing
the elements of good priority setting to each plan, before conducting
comparative analysis across the sample. Our findings suggest that while
some pre-requisites for effective priority setting were present in many
cases - including political commitment and a recognition of the need for
allocation decisions - many other hallmarks were less evident, such as
explicit ethical criteria, decision making frameworks, and engagement
processes. This study provides a unique insight into the role of
priority setting in the European response to the onset of the COVID-19
pandemic.

Recommendations for supporting healthcare workers’ psychological

</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Healthcare workers are at risk of adverse mental health outcomes due to
occupational stress. Many organizations introduced initiatives to
proactively support staff’s psychological well-being in the face of the
COVID-19 pandemic. One example is the STEADY wellness program, which was
implemented in a large trauma centre in Toronto, Canada. Program
implementors engaged teams in peer support sessions, psychoeducation
workshops, critical incident stress debriefing, and community-building
initiatives. As part of a project designed to illuminate the experiences
of STEADY program implementors, this article describes recommendations
for future hospital wellness programs. Participants described the
importance of having the hospital and its leaders engage in supporting
staff’s psychological well-being. They recommended ways of doing so
(e.g., incorporating conversations about wellness in staff onboarding
and routine meetings), along with ways to increase program uptake and
sustainability (e.g., using technology to increase accessibility).
Results may be useful in future efforts to bolster hospital wellness
programming.

“There’s a little bit of mistrust”: Red River Métis experiences of the
H1N1 and COVID-19 pandemics.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
We examined the perspectives of the Red River Métis citizens in
Manitoba, Canada, during the H1N1 and COVID-19 pandemics and how they
interpreted the communication of government/health authorities’ risk
management decisions. For Indigenous populations, pandemic response
strategies play out within the context of ongoing colonial relationships
with government institutions characterized by significant distrust. A
crucial difference between the two pandemics was that the Métis in
Manitoba were prioritized for early vaccine access during H1N1 but not
for COVID-19. Data collection involved 17 focus groups with Métis
citizens following the H1N1 outbreak and 17 focus groups during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Métis prioritization during H1N1 was met with some
apprehension and fear that Indigenous Peoples were vaccine-safety test
subjects before population-wide distribution occurred. By contrast, as
one of Canada’s three recognized Indigenous nations, the
non-prioritization of the Métis during COVID-19 was viewed as an
egregious sign of disrespect and indifference. Our research demonstrates
that both reactions were situated within claims that the government does
not care about the Métis, referencing past and ongoing colonial
motivations. Government and health institutions must anticipate this
overarching colonial context when making and communicating risk
management decisions with Indigenous Peoples. In this vein, government
authorities must work toward a praxis of decolonization in these
relationships, including, for example, working in partnership with
Indigenous nations to engage in collaborative risk mitigation and
communication that meets the unique needs of Indigenous populations and
limits the potential for less benign-though
understandable-interpretations.

Did Descriptive and Prescriptive Norms About Gender Equality at Home

</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Using data from 15 countries, this article investigates whether
descriptive and prescriptive gender norms concerning housework and child
care (domestic work) changed after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Results of a total of 8,343 participants (M = 19.95, SD = 1.68) from two
comparable student samples suggest that descriptive norms about unpaid
domestic work have been affected by the pandemic, with individuals
seeing mothers’ relative to fathers’ share of housework and child care
as even larger. Moderation analyses revealed that the effect of the
pandemic on descriptive norms about child care decreased with countries’
increasing levels of gender equality; countries with stronger gender
inequality showed a larger difference between pre- and post-pandemic.
This study documents a shift in descriptive norms and discusses
implications for gender equality-emphasizing the importance of
addressing the additional challenges that mothers face during
health-related crises.

<td style="text-align:left;">
Our understanding of the quality of cellular and humoral immunity
conferred by COVID-19 vaccination alone versus vaccination plus
SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough (BT) infection remains incomplete. While the
current (2023) SARS-CoV-2 immune landscape of Canadians is complex, in
late 2021 most Canadians had either just received a third dose of
COVID-19 vaccine, or had received their two-dose primary series and then
experienced an Omicron BT. Herein we took advantage of this coincident
timing to contrast cellular and humoral immunity conferred by three
doses of vaccine versus two doses plus BT. Our results show thatBT
infection induces cell-mediated immune responses to variants comparable
to an intramuscular vaccine booster dose. In contrast, BT subjects had
higher salivary immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgA levels against the Omicron
spike and enhanced reactivity to the ancestral spike for the IgA
isotype, which also reacted with SARS-CoV-1. Serumneutralizing antibody
levels against the ancestral strain and the variants were also higher
after BT infection. Our results support the need for the development of
intranasal vaccines that could emulate the enhanced mucosal and humoral
immunity induced by Omicron BT without exposing individuals to the risks
associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Supporting schooling for current and past pediatric oncology patients is
vital to their quality of life and psychosocial recovery. However, no
study has examined the perspectives toward in-person schooling among
pediatric oncology families during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this online
survey study, we determined the rate of and attitudes toward in-person
school attendance among current and past pediatric oncology patients
living in Ontario, Canada during the 2020-2021 school year. Of our
31-family cohort, 23 children (74%) did attend and 8 (26%) did not
attend any in-person school during this time. Fewer children within 2
years of treatment completion attended in-person school (5/8; 62%) than
those more than 2 years from treatment completion (13/15; 87%). Notably,
22 of 29 parents (76%) felt that speaking to their care team had the
greatest impact compared to other potential information sources when
deciding about school participation, yet 13 (45%) were unaware of their
physician’s specific recommendation regarding whether their child should
attend. This study highlights the range in parental comfort regarding
permitting in-person schooling during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pediatric
oncologists should continue to address parental concerns around
in-person school during times of high transmission of COVID-19 and
potentially other communicable diseases in the future.

the COVID-19 pandemic.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the lives of people with
intellectual disabilities in many ways, impacting their health and
wellbeing. Early in the pandemic, the research team delivered a six-week
virtual group-based program to help Canadian adults with intellectual
disabilities cope and better manage their mental health. The study’s
objective was to explore ongoing concerns among individuals with
intellectual disabilities following their participation in this
education and support program. Thematic analysis was used to analyze
participant feedback provided eight weeks after course completion.
Twenty-four participants were interviewed in January 2021 and May 2021
across two cycles of the course. Three themes emerged: 1) employment and
financial challenges; 2) navigating changes and ongoing restrictions;
and 3) vaccine anticipation and experience. These findings suggest that
despite benefiting from the program, participants continued to
experience pandemic-related challenges in 2021, emphasising the need to
continually engage people with intellectual disabilities.

Economic precarity and changing levels of anxiety and stress among
Canadians with disabilities and chronic health conditions throughout the
COVID-19 pandemic.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple event stressors converged to
exacerbate a growing mental health crisis in Canada with differing
effects across status groups. However, less is known about changing
mental health situations throughout the pandemic, especially among
individuals more likely to experience chronic stress because of their
disability and health status. Using data from two waves of a targeted
online survey of people with disabilities and chronic health conditions
in Canada (N = 563 individuals, June 2020 and July 2021), we find that
approximately 25% of respondents experienced additional increases in
stress and anxiety levels in 2021. These increases were partly explained
by worsening perceived financial insecurity and, in the case of stress,
additional negative financial effects tied to the pandemic. This paper
understands mental health disparities as a function of social status and
social group membership. By linking stress process models and a minority
stress framework with a social model of disability, we allude to how
structural and contextual barriers make functional limitations disabling
and in turn, life stressors.

Exploring the Lived Experiences of Individuals With Spinal Cord Injury
During the COVID-19 Pandemic.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
The global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2019
(COVID-19) has affected over 100 countries and has led to the tragic
loss of life, overwhelmed health care systems and severely impacted the
global economy. Specifically, individuals living with spinal cord injury
(SCI) are particularly vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic as they
often face adverse impacts on their health, emotional well-being,
community participation, and life expectancy. The objective of this
study was to investigate the lived experience of individuals with SCI
during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, Canada. An exploratory design
with a qualitative descriptive approach was used to address the study
objective. Nine semi-structured interviews were conducted with
individuals with traumatic and non-traumatic SCI (37-69 years, C3-L5,
AIS A-D, and 5-42 years post-injury). Using reflexive thematic analysis,
the following themes were created: (1) Caregiver exposure to COVID-19;
(2) Staying physically active in quarantine; (3) Living in social
isolation; (4) Difficulty obtaining necessary medical supplies; (5)
Access to health services and virtual care during COVID-19; and (6)
Fighting COVID-19 misinformation. This is one of the first studies to
explore the impact of COVID-19 on individuals living with SCI in
Ontario. This study contributes to a greater understanding of the
challenges faced by individuals living with SCI and provides insight
into how to better support and respond to the specific and unique needs
of individuals with SCI and their families during a national emergency
or pandemic.

Structural and biochemical rationale for Beta variant protein booster
vaccine broad cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, uses a surface expressed trimeric
spike glycoprotein for cell entry. This trimer is the primary target for
neutralizing antibodies making it a key candidate for vaccine
development. During the global pandemic circulating variants of concern
(VOC) caused several waves of infection, severe disease, and death. The
reduced efficacy of the ancestral trimer-based vaccines against emerging
VOC led to the need for booster vaccines. Here we present a detailed
characterization of the Sanofi Beta trimer, utilizing cryo-EM for
structural elucidation. We investigate the conformational dynamics and
stabilizing features using orthogonal SPR, SEC, nanoDSF, and HDX-MS
techniques to better understand how this antigen elicits superior broad
neutralizing antibodies as a variant booster vaccine. This structural
analysis confirms the Beta trimer preference for canonical quaternary
structure with two RBD in the up position and the reversible equilibrium
between the canonical spike and open trimer conformations. Moreover,
this report provides a better understanding of structural differences
between spike antigens contributing to differential vaccine efficacy.

Hypofractionated Radiotherapy in Gynecologic Malignancies-A Peek into
the Upcoming Evidence.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Radiotherapy (RT) has a fundamental role in the treatment of gynecologic
malignancies, including cervical and uterine cancers. Hypofractionated
RT has gained popularity in many cancer sites, boosted by technological
advances in treatment delivery and image verification. Hypofractionated
RT uptake was intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic and has the
potential to improve universal access to radiotherapy worldwide,
especially in low-resource settings. This review summarizes the
rationale, the current challenges and investigation efforts, together
with the recent developments associated with hypofractionated RT in
gynecologic malignancies. A comprehensive search was undertaken using
multiple databases and ongoing trial registries. In the definitive
radiotherapy setting for cervical cancers, there are several ongoing
clinical trials from Canada, Mexico, Iran, the Philippines and Thailand
investigating the role of a moderate hypofractionated external beam RT
regimen in the low-risk locally advanced population. Likewise, there are
ongoing ultra and moderate hypofractionated RT trials in the uterine
cancer setting. One Canadian prospective trial of stereotactic
hypofractionated adjuvant RT for uterine cancer patients suggested a
good tolerance to this treatment strategy in the acute setting, with a
follow-up trial currently randomizing patients between conventional
fractionation and the hypofractionated dose regimen delivered in the
former trial. Although not yet ready for prime-time use,
hypofractionated RT could be a potential solution to several challenges
that limit access to and the utilization of radiotherapy for gynecologic
cancer patients worldwide.

Predictors of Breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 Infection after Vaccination.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
The initial two-dose vaccine series and subsequent booster vaccine doses
have been effective in modulating SARS-CoV-2 disease severity and death
but do not completely prevent infection. The correlates of infection
despite vaccination continue to be under investigation. In this
prospective decentralized study (n = 1286) comparing antibody responses
in an older- (≥70 years) to a younger-aged cohort (aged 30-50 years), we
explored the correlates of breakthrough infection in 983 eligible
subjects. Participants self-reported data on initial vaccine series,
subsequent booster doses and COVID-19 infections in an online portal and
provided self-collected dried blood spots for antibody testing by ELISA.
Multivariable survival analysis explored the correlates of breakthrough
infection. An association between higher antibody levels and protection
from breakthrough infection observed during the Delta and Omicron BA.1/2
waves of infection no longer existed during the Omicron BA.4/5 wave. The
older-aged cohort was less likely to have a breakthrough infection at
all time-points. Receipt of an original/Omicron vaccine and the presence
of hybrid immunity were associated with protection of infection during
the later Omicron BA.4/5 and XBB waves. We were unable to determine a
threshold antibody to define protection from infection or to guide
vaccine booster schedules.

COVID-19 Pandemic, Physical Distancing Policies, and the Non-Profit
Sector Volunteer Force.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Although COVID-19-related physical distancing has had large economic
consequences, the impact on volunteerism is unclear. Using volunteer
position postings data from Canada’s largest volunteer center (Volunteer
Toronto) from February 3, 2020, to January 4, 2021, we evaluated the
impact of different levels of physical distancing on average views,
total views, and total number of posts. There was about a 50% decrease
in the total number of posts that was sustained throughout the pandemic.
Although a more restrictive physical distancing policy was generally
associated with fewer views, there was an initial increase in views
during the first lockdown where total views were elevated for the first
4 months of the pandemic. This was driven by interest in
COVID-19-related and remote work postings. This highlights the community
of volunteers may be quite flexible in terms of adapting to new ways of
volunteering, but substantial challenges remain for the continued
operations of many non-profit organizations.

Mental Health Outcomes of Endometriosis Patients during the COVID-19
Pandemic: Impact of Pre-pandemic Central Nervous System Sensitization.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
To correlate pain-related phenotyping for central nervous system
sensitization in endometriosis-associated pain with mental health
outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic, the prospective Endometriosis and
Pelvic Pain Interdisciplinary Cohort (ClinicalTrials.gov \#NCT02911090)
was linked to the COVID-19 Rapid Evidence Study of a Provincial
Population-Based Cohort for Gender and Sex (RESPPONSE) dataset. The
primary outcomes were depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) scores
during the pandemic. The explanatory variables of interest were the
Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI) score (0-100) and
endometriosis-associated chronic pain comorbidities/psychological
variables before the pandemic. The explanatory and response variables
were assessed for correlation, followed by multivariable regression
analyses adjusting for PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores pre-pandemic as well as
age, body mass index, and parity. A higher CSI score and a greater
number of chronic pain comorbidities before the pandemic were both
positively correlated with PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores during the pandemic.
These associations remained significant in adjusted analyses. Increasing
the CSI score by 10 was associated with an increase in pandemic PHQ-9 by
.74 points (P &lt; .0001) and GAD-7 by .73 points (P &lt; .0001) on
average. Each additional chronic pain comorbidity/psychological variable
was associated with an increase in pandemic PHQ-9 by an average of .63
points (P = .0004) and GAD-7 by .53 points (P = .0002). Endometriosis
patients with a history of central sensitization before the pandemic had
worse mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a risk
factor for mental health symptoms in the face of major stressors,
clinical proxies for central sensitization can be used to identify
endometriosis patients who may need additional support. PERSPECTIVE:
This article adds to the growing literature of the clinical importance
of central sensitization in endometriosis patients, who had more
symptoms of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Clinical features of central sensitization may help clinicians identify
endometriosis patients needing additional support when facing major
stressors.

Under what conditions do citizens support coercive public policies?
Although recent research suggests that people prefer policies that
preserve freedom of choice, such as behavioural nudges, many citizens
accepted stringent policy interventions like fines and mandates to
promote vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic-a pattern that may be
linked to the unusually high effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. We
conducted a large online survey experiment (N = 42,417) in the Group of
Seven (G-7) countries investigating the relationship between a policy’s
effectiveness and public support for stringent policies. Our results
indicate that public support for stringent vaccination policies
increases as vaccine effectiveness increases, but at a modest scale.
This relationship flattens at higher levels of vaccine effectiveness.
These results suggest that intervention effectiveness can be a
significant predictor of support for coercive policies but only up to
some threshold of effectiveness.

Enhancing Minds in Motion® as a virtual program delivery model for

The Alzheimer Society of Ontario’s Minds in Motion (MiM) program
improves physical function and well-being of people living with dementia
(PLWD) and their care partners (CP) (Regan et al., 2019). With the
COVID-19 pandemic, there was an urgent need to transition to a virtual
MiM that was similarly safe and effective. The purpose of this mixed
methods study is to describe the standardized, virtual MiM and evaluate
its acceptability, and impact on quality of life, and physical and
cognitive activity of participants. Survey of ad hoc virtual MiM
practices and a literature review informed the design of the
standardized MiM program: 8 weeks of weekly 90-minute sessions that
included 45-minutes of physical activity and 45-minutes of cognitive
stimulation in each session. Participants completed a standardized,
virtual MiM at one of 6 participating Alzheimer Societies in Ontario, as
well as assessments of quality of life, physical and cognitive activity,
and program satisfaction pre- and post-program. In all, 111 PLWD and 90
CP participated in the evaluation (average age of 74.6±9.4 years, 61.2%
had a college/university degree or greater, 80.6% were married, 48.6% of
PLWD and 75.6% of CP were women). No adverse events occurred. MiM
participants rated the program highly (average score of 4.5/5). PLWD
reported improved quality of life post-MiM (p = &lt;0.01). Altogether,
participants reported increased physical activity levels (p = &lt;0.01)
and cognitive activity levels (p = &lt;0.01). The virtual MiM program is
acceptable, safe, and effective at improving quality of life, cognitive
and physical activity levels for PLWD, and cognitive and physical
activity levels among CP.

Noninvasive Ventilation Before Intubation and Mortality in Patients
Receiving Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for COVID-19: An Analysis
of the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Registry.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Bilevel-positive airway pressure (BiPAP) is a noninvasive respiratory
support modality which reduces effort in patients with respiratory
failure. However, it may increase tidal ventilation and transpulmonary
pressure, potentially aggravating lung injury. We aimed to assess if the
use of BiPAP before intubation was associated with increased mortality
in adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who received
venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We used the
Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Registry to analyze adult
patients with COVID-19 supported with venovenous ECMO from January 1,
2020, to December 31, 2021. Patients treated with BiPAP were compared
with patients who received other modalities of respiratory support or no
respiratory support. A total of 9,819 patients from 421 centers were
included. A total of 3,882 of them (39.5%) were treated with BiPAP
before endotracheal intubation. Patients supported with BiPAP were
intubated later (4.3 vs. 3.3 days, p &lt; 0.001) and showed higher
unadjusted hospital mortality (51.7% vs. 44.9%, p &lt; 0.001). The use
of BiPAP before intubation and time from hospital admission to
intubation resulted as independently associated with increased hospital
mortality (odds ratio \[OR\], 1.32 \[95% confidence interval {CI},
1.08-1.61\] and 1.03 \[1-1.06\] per day increase). In ECMO patients with
severe acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19, the extended use of
BiPAP before intubation should be regarded as a risk factor for
mortality.

Modelling disease mitigation at mass gatherings: A case study of

</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
The 2022 FIFA World Cup was the first major multi-continental sporting
Mass Gathering Event (MGE) of the post COVID-19 era to allow foreign
spectators. Such large-scale MGEs can potentially lead to outbreaks of
infectious disease and contribute to the global dissemination of such
pathogens. Here we adapt previous work and create a generalisable model
framework for assessing the use of disease control strategies at such
events, in terms of reducing infections and hospitalisations. This
framework utilises a combination of meta-populations based on clusters
of people and their vaccination status, Ordinary Differential Equation
integration between fixed time events, and Latin Hypercube sampling. We
use the FIFA 2022 World Cup as a case study for this framework
(modelling each match as independent 7 day MGEs). Pre-travel screenings
of visitors were found to have little effect in reducing COVID-19
infections and hospitalisations. With pre-match screenings of spectators
and match staff being more effective. Rapid Antigen (RA) screenings 0.5
days before match day performed similarly to RT-PCR screenings 1.5 days
before match day. Combinations of pre-travel and pre-match testing led
to improvements. However, a policy of ensuring that all visitors had a
COVID-19 vaccination (second or booster dose) within a few months before
departure proved to be much more efficacious. The State of Qatar
abandoned all COVID-19 related travel testing and vaccination
requirements over the period of the World Cup. Our work suggests that
the State of Qatar may have been correct in abandoning the pre-travel
testing of visitors. However, there was a spike in COVID-19 cases and
hospitalisations within Qatar over the World Cup. Given our findings and
the spike in cases, we suggest a policy requiring visitors to have had a
recent COVID-19 vaccination should have been in place to reduce cases
and hospitalisations.

COVID-19 unleashed a maelstrom of distress on health care professionals.
The pandemic contributed to a host of stressors for workers because of
the need for rapid acquisition of new knowledge and skills to provide
best treatment while simultaneously dealing with personal safety,
limited resources, staffing shortages, and access to care issues.
Concurrently, problems with systemic racial inequality and
discrimination became more apparent secondary to difficulties with
accessing health care for minorities and other marginalized groups.
These problems contributed to many health care professionals
experiencing severe moral injury and burnout as they struggled to uphold
core values and do their jobs professionally. Some left or disengaged.
Others died. As continuing professional development leaders focused on
all health professionals, we must act deliberately to address health
care professionals’ distress and mental health. We must incorporate
wellness and mental health as organizing principles in all we do. We
must adopt a new mental model that recognizes the importance of
learners’ biopsychosocial functioning and commit to learners’ wellness
by developing activities that embrace a biopsychosocial point of view.
As educators and influencers, we must demonstrate that the Institute for
Healthcare Improvement’s fourth aim to improve clinician well-being and
safety (2014) and fifth aim to address health equity and the social
determinants of health (2021) matter. It is crucial that continuing

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of global health
diplomacy (GHD), with India emerging as a key player. India’s commitment
to GHD is demonstrated by its active participation in regional and
multilateral projects, pharmaceutical expertise, and large-scale
manufacturing capabilities, which include the production and
distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and essential medicines. India has
supported nations in need through bilateral and multilateral platforms,
providing vaccines to countries experiencing shortages and offering
technical assistance and capacity-building programs to improve
healthcare infrastructure and response capabilities. India’s unique
approach to GHD, rooted in humanitarian diplomacy, emphasized
collaboration and empathy and stressed the well-being of humanity by
embracing the philosophy of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,” which translates to
“the world is one family.” Against this background, this paper’s main
focus is to analyze the rise of India’s GHD amidst the COVID-19 pandemic
and its leadership in addressing various global challenges. India has
demonstrated its commitment to global solidarity by offering medical
supplies, equipment, and expertise to more than 100 countries. India’s
rising global leadership can be attributed to its proactive approach,
humanitarian diplomacy, and significant contributions to global health
initiatives.

RéSUMé: OBJECTIFS: Explorer les expériences de femmes métisses et de
personnes métisses bispirituelles et de diverses identités de genre
ayant accédé aux services sociaux et de santé à Victoria
(Colombie-Britannique) pendant la pandémie de COVID-19, et en tirer des
leçons. MéTHODE: Cet article vient d’une vaste étude sur les expériences
de femmes métisses et de personnes métisses bispirituelles et de
diverses identités de genre ayant accédé aux services sociaux et de
santé à Victoria. À l’aide d’une démarche par et pour les personnes
métisses qui a fait appel à une méthode d’entrevue directe, nous avons
mené des entrevues avec des femmes métisses et des personnes
bispirituelles et de diverses identités de genre ayant vécu à Victoria
en décembre 2020 et janvier 2021 et/ou accédé à des services dans cette
ville durant cette période. Le présent article porte spécifiquement sur
les données liées aux incidences de la COVID-19 chez ces personnes.
RéSULTATS: En tout, 24 femmes et personnes métisses bispirituelles et de
diverses identités de genre ont participé à l’étude. Dans l’ensemble,
trois aspects relatifs à la COVID-19 sont ressortis des données.
Premièrement, les personnes participantes ont décrit les effets
préjudiciables de la COVID-19 sur leur capacité de rester en lien avec
leur communauté métisse et de pratiquer leur culture, ainsi que leurs
sentiments d’isolement en général. Deuxièmement, elles ont souligné
certaines des façons dont la COVID-19 a exacerbé les barrières
existantes à l’accès aux soins de santé culturellement sûrs. Enfin, les
personnes participantes ont parlé des retombées économiques mitigées de
la COVID-19 dans leur cas, et elles ont partagé leurs idées sur le rôle
du genre, en particulier, dans leur instabilité financière. CONCLUSION:
Pour atténuer les effets préjudiciables disproportionnés de la pandémie
et améliorer les résultats cliniques globaux au sein des communautés
métisses du Canada, il est essentiel d’améliorer l’accès aux services
sociaux et de santé culturellement sûrs en y intégrant les expériences
et le savoir-faire de femmes métisses et de personnes métisses
bispirituelles et de diverses identités de genre.

A global comparative analysis of the criteria and equity considerations
included in eighty-six national COVID-19 plans.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Systematic priority setting (PS), based on explicit criteria, is thought
to improve the quality and consistency of the PS decisions. Among the PS
criteria, there is increased focus on the importance of equity
considerations and vulnerable populations. This paper discusses the PS
criteria that were included in the national COVID-19 pandemic plans,
with specific focus on equity and on the vulnerable populations
considered. Secondary synthesis of data, from a global comparative study
that examined the degree to which the COVID-19 plans included PS, was
conducted. Only 32 % of the plans identified explicit criteria. Severity
of the disease and/or disease burden were the commonly mentioned
criteria. With regards to equity considerations and prioritizing
vulnerable populations, 22 countries identified people with
co-morbidities others mentioned children, women etc. Low social-economic
status and internally displaced population were not identified in any of
the reviewed national plans. The limited inclusion of explicit criteria
and equity considerations highlight a need for policy makers, in all
contexts, to consider instituting and equipping PS institutions who can
engage diverse stakeholders in identifying the relevant PS criteria
during the post pandemic period. While vulnerability will vary with the
type of health emergency- awareness of this and having mechanisms for
identifying and prioritizing the most vulnerable will support equitable
pandemic responses.

COVID-19. MéTHODES: Certains TdS de l’Alberta (Canada) participant à une
cohorte interprovinciale, ont consenti à ce que la base administrative
de santé de l’Alberta (AHDB) nous transmette leurs données de
vaccination contre la COVID-19 et de tests d’amplification des acides

cinq témoins de population générale. Les diagnostics médicaux (par
médecins) de COVID-19 ont été identifiés dans l’AHDB du début de la
pandémie jusqu’au 31 mars 2022. Les consultations médicales pour PSM
(anxiété, stress/troubles de l’adaptation, dépression) ont été
identifiées entre le 1er avril 2017 et le 31 mars 2022. Les rapports de
cotes (RC) comparant les TdS aux témoins de la population générale ont
été estimés pour chaque vague d’infection. RéSULTATS: Quatre-vingts
pourcent (80 %; 3050/3812) des TdS ont donné leur consentement à ce que
leurs données nous soient transmises par l’AHDB; 97 % d’entre eux
(2959/3050) ont été appariés à 14 546 témoins. Dans l’ensemble, les TdS
étaient plus à risque de COVID-19, avec une première infection
identifiée soit par les TANN (RC=1,96, IC de 95% 1,76-2,17), soit via
les dossiers médicaux (RC=1,33, IC de 95% 1,21-1,45). Ils étaient
également plus à risque pour chacun des trois problèmes de SM. Le risque
de COVID-19 ajustés pour les facteurs de confusion était plus élevé que
chez les témoins au début de la pandémie et durant la cinquième vague
(variant Omicron). Les excès de risque de stress/troubles de
l’adaptation (RC=1,52, IC de 95% 1,35-1,71) et de dépression (RC=1,39,
IC de 95% 1,24-1,55) ont augmenté au fil des vagues de l’épidémie, avec
un pic à la quatrième vague. CONCLUSION: Les TdS étaient plus à risque
d’infection de COVID-19 et de troubles de santé mentale avec cet excès

COVID-19 pandemic impact on the potential exacerbation of screening
mammography disparities: A population-based study in Ontario, Canada.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Strategies to ramp up breast cancer screening after COVID-19 require
data on the influence of the pandemic on groups of women with
historically low screening uptake. Using data from Ontario, Canada, our
objectives were to 1) quantify the overall pandemic impact on weekly
bilateral screening mammography rates (per 100,000) of average-risk
women aged 50-74 and 2) examine if COVID-19 has shifted any mammography
inequalities according to age, immigration status, rurality, and access
to material resources. Using a segmented negative binomial regression
model, we estimated the mean change in rate at the start of the pandemic
(the week of March 15, 2020) and changes in weekly trend of rates during
the pandemic period (March 15-December 26, 2020) compared to the
pre-pandemic period (January 3, 2016-March 14, 2020) for all women and
for each subgroup. A 3-way interaction term (COVID-19*week*subgroup
variable) was added to the model to detect any pandemic impact on
screening disparities. Of the 3,481,283 mammograms, 8.6 % (n = 300,064)
occurred during the pandemic period. Overall, the mean weekly rate
dropped by 93.4 % (95 % CI 91.7 % - 94.8 %) at the beginning of
COVID-19, followed by a weekly increase of 8.4 % (95 % CI 7.4 % - 9.4 %)
until December 26, 2020. The pandemic did not shift any disparities (all
interactions p &gt; 0.05) and that women who were under 60 or over 70,
immigrants, or with a limited access to material resources had
persistently low screening rate in both periods. Interventions should
proactively target these underserved populations with the goals of
reducing advanced-stage breast cancer presentations and mortality.

Humanitarian-Development Nexus: strengthening health system

Sudan-case study of repositioning external assistance model and focus.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic and the establishment of a new
transitional government in Sudan with rejuvenated relations with the
international community paved the way for external assistance to the EU
COVID-19 response project, a project with a pioneering design within the
region. The project sought to operationalize the
humanitarian-development-peace nexus, perceiving the nexus as a
continuum rather than sequential due to the protracted nature of
emergencies in Sudan and their multiplicity and contextual complexity.
It went further into enhancing peace through engaging with conflict and
post-conflict-affected states and communities and empowering local
actors. Learning from this experience, external assistance models to
low- or middle-income countries (LMICs) should apply principles of
flexibility and adaptability, while maintaining trust through
transparency in exchange, to ensure sustainable and responsive action to
domestic needs within changing contexts. Careful selection and diverse
project team skills, early and continuous engagement with stakeholders,
and robust planning, monitoring and evaluation processes were the
project highlights. Yet, the challenges of political turmoil, changing
Ministry of Health leadership, competing priorities and inactive
coordination mechanisms had to be dealt with. While applying such an
approach of a health system lens to health emergencies in LMICs is
thought to be a success factor in this case, more robust technical
guidance to the nexus implementation is crucial and can be best attained
through encouraging further case reports analysing context-specific
practices.

Prospective monitoring of adverse events following vaccination with
Modified vaccinia Ankara - Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN) administered to a
Canadian population at risk of Mpox: A Canadian Immunization Research
Network study.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
MVA-BN is an orthopoxvirus vaccine that provides protection against both
smallpox and mpox. In June 2022, Canada launched a publicly-funded
vaccination campaign to offer MVA-BN to at-risk populations including
men who have sex with men (MSM) and sex workers. The safety of MVA-BN
has not been assessed in this context. To address this, the Canadian
National Vaccine Safety Network (CANVAS) conducted prospective safety
surveillance during public health vaccination campaigns in Toronto,
Ontario and in Vancouver, British Columbia. Vaccinated participants
received a survey 7 and 30 days after each MVA-BN dose to elicit adverse
health events. Unvaccinated individuals from a concurrent vaccine safety
project evaluating COVID-19 vaccine safety were used as controls.
Vaccinated and unvaccinated participants that reported a medically
attended visit on their 7-day survey were interviewed. Vaccinated
participants and unvaccinated controls were matched 1:1 based on age
group, gender, sex and provincial study site. Overall, 1,173 vaccinated
participants completed a 7-day survey, of whom 75 % (n = 878) also
completed a 30-day survey. Mild to moderate injection site pain was
reported by 60 % of vaccinated participants. Among vaccinated
participants 8.4 % were HIV positive and when compared to HIV negative
vaccinated individuals, local injection sites were less frequent in
those with HIV (48 % vs 61 %, p = 0.021), but health events preventing
work/school or requiring medical assessment were more frequent (7.1 % vs
3.1 %, p = 0.040). Health events interfering with work/school, or
requiring medical assessment were less common in the vaccinated group
than controls (3.3 % vs. 7.1 %, p &lt; 0.010). No participants were
hospitalized within 7 or 30 days of vaccination. No cases of severe
neurological disease, skin disease, or myocarditis were identified. Our
results demonstrate that the MVA-BN vaccine appears safe when used for
mpox prevention, with a low frequency of severe adverse events and no
hospitalizations observed.

Social support buffers the impact of pregnancy stress on perceptions of
parent-infant closeness during the COVID-19 pandemic.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Pregnant individuals and parents have experienced elevated mental health
problems and stress during COVID-19. Stress during pregnancy can be
harmful to the fetus and detrimental to the parent-child relationship.
However, social support is known to act as a protective factor,
buffering against the adverse effects of stress. The present study
examined whether (1) prenatal stress during COVID-19 was associated with
parent-infant closeness at 6 months postpartum, and (2) social support
moderated the effect of prenatal stress on the parent-infant
relationship. In total, 181 participants completed questionnaires during
pregnancy and at 6 months postpartum. A hierarchical linear regression
analysis was conducted to assess whether social support moderated the
effect of stress during pregnancy on parent-infant closeness at 6 months
postpartum. Results indicated a significant interaction between prenatal
stress and social support on parents’ perceptions of closeness with
their infants at 6 months postpartum (β = .805, p = .029); parents who
experienced high prenatal stress with high social support reported
greater parent-infant closeness, compared to those who reported high
levels of stress and low social support. Findings underscore the
importance of social support in protecting the parent-infant
relationship, particularly in times of high stress, such as during the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Critical research gaps in treating growth faltering in infants under 6
months: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
In 2020, 149.2 million children worldwide under 5 years suffered from
stunting, and 45.4 million experienced wasting. Many infants are born
already stunted, while others are at high risk for growth faltering
early after birth. Growth faltering is linked to transgenerational
impacts of poverty and marginalization. Few interventions address growth
faltering in infants under 6 months, despite a likely increasing
prevalence due to the negative global economic impacts of the COVID-19
pandemic. Breastfeeding is a critical intervention to alleviate
malnutrition and improve child health outcomes, but rarely receives
adequate attention in growth faltering interventions. A systematic
review and meta-analysis were undertaken to identify and evaluate
interventions addressing growth faltering among infants under 6 months
that employed supplemental milks. The review was carried out following
guidelines from the USA National Academy of Medicine. A total of 10,405
references were identified, and after deduplication 7390 studies were
screened for eligibility. Of these, 227 were assessed for full text
eligibility and relevance. Two randomized controlled trials were
ultimately included, which differed in inclusion criteria and
methodology and had few shared outcomes. Both studies had small sample
sizes, high attrition and high risk of bias. A Bangladeshi study (n =
153) found significantly higher rates of weight gain for F-100 and
diluted F-100 (DF-100) compared with infant formula (IF), while a DRC
trial (n = 146) did not find statistically significant differences in
rate of weight gain for DF-100 compared with IF offered in the context
of broader lactation and relactation support. The meta-analysis of rate
of weight gain showed no statistical difference and some evidence of
moderate heterogeneity. Few interventions address growth faltering among
infants under 6 months. These studies have limited generalizability and
have not comprehensively supported lactation. Greater investment is
necessary to accelerate research that addresses growth faltering
following a new research framework that calls for comprehensive
lactation support.

RéSUMé: OBJECTIF: Nous avons cherché à mesurer l’influence des
antécédents psychologiques de vaccination sur l’intention de se faire

métisse de l’Ontario (NMO). MéTHODE: Un sondage populationnel en ligne a
été mis en œuvre par la NMO quand des vaccins contre la COVID-19 ont été
approuvés au Canada. Les questions posées ont porté sur l’intention de
se faire vacciner, la version abrégée du modèle « 5C » de l’échelle de
vaccination (Confiance, Contraintes, Complaisance, Calcul et
responsabilité Collective) et le profil sociodémographique. Nous avons
utilisé l’échantillonnage fondé sur le recensement via le registre de la
NMO pour obtenir un taux de réponse de 39 %. Des statistiques
descriptives, des analyses bivariées et des modèles de régression
logistique multinomiale (ajustés selon les variables
sociodémographiques) ont servi à analyser les données du sondage.
RéSULTATS: La majorité (70,2 %) des citoyennes et citoyens de la NMO
prévoyaient se faire vacciner. Comparativement aux personnes réticentes
à l’égard de la vaccination, les personnes ayant l’intention de se faire
vacciner avaient plus confiance en l’innocuité des vaccins contre la
COVID-19, considéraient la COVID-19 comme une maladie grave, étaient
disposées à protéger les autres contre la COVID-19 et cherchaient à se
renseigner au sujet des vaccins (Confiance : RC = 19,4, IC95% 15,5–24,2;
Complaisance : RC = 6,21, IC95% 5,38–7,18; responsabilité Collective :
RC = 9,83, IC95% 8,24–11,72; Calcul : RC = 1,43, IC95% 1,28–1,59).
Enfin, les répondantes et les répondants ayant l’intention de se faire
vacciner étaient moins susceptibles de laisser le stress quotidien les
empêcher de se faire vacciner contre la COVID-19 (RC = 0,47, IC95%
0,42–0,53) comparativement aux personnes réticentes à l’égard de la
vaccination. CONCLUSION: Cette étude contribue à la base de
connaissances sur la santé des Métis et a appuyé les activités de
sensibilisation et d’échange d’informations de la NMO pendant le

Shifting gears: Creating equity informed leaders for effective learning

</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Leadership is vital to a well-functioning and effective health system.
This importance was underscored during the COVID-19 pandemic. As
disparities in infection and mortality rates became pronounced, greater
calls for equity-informed healthcare emerged. These calls led some
leaders to use the Learning Health System (LHS) approach to quickly
transform research into healthcare practice to mitigate inequities
causing these rates. The LHS is a relatively new framework informed by
many within and outside health systems, supported by decision-makers and
financial arrangements and encouraged by a culture that fosters quick
learning and improvements. Although studies indicate the LHS can enhance
patients’ health outcomes, scarce literature exists on health system
leaders’ use and incorporation of equity into the LHS. This commentary
begins addressing this gap by examining how equity can be incorporated
into LHS activities and discussing ways leaders can ensure equity is
considered and achieved in rapid learning cycles.

Pornography and sexual function in the post-pandemic period: a narrative

</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns had significant impacts on sexual
functioning and behavior. Partnered sexual activity decreased overall,
while solo sex activities such as masturbation and pornography
consumption increased exponentially. Given the ongoing debate about the
effects of pornography on sexual function, it was prudent to consider
how the increase in porn consumption during the pandemic might have
impacted sexual function in the post-pandemic period. Results indicated
that despite the increased rates of use during lockdowns, there remains
no evidence supporting the relationship between sexual dysfunction and
porn use during and following the pandemic period. On the contrary,
pornography consumption and solo sex activities offered an alternative
to conventional sexual behavior during a highly stressful period and
were found to have positive effects of relieving psychosocial stress
otherwise induced by the pandemic. Specifically, those who maintained an
active sexual life experienced less anxiety and depression, and greater
relational health than those who were not sexually active. It is
important to consider factors including frequency, context, and type of
consumption when analyzing the impact of pornography on sexual function.
While excessive use can have negative effects, moderate use can be a
natural and healthy part of life.

Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on prescription stimulant use among children

</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
COVID-19 associated public health measures and school closures
exacerbated symptoms in some children and youth with attention-deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Less well understood is how the pandemic
influenced patterns of prescription stimulant use. We conducted a
population-based study of stimulant dispensing to children and youth ≤
24 years old between January 1, 2013, and June 30, 2022. We used
structural break analyses to identify the pandemic month(s) when changes
in the dispensing of stimulants occurred. We used interrupted time
series models to quantify changes in dispensing following the structural
break and compare observed and expected stimulant use. Our main outcome
was the change in the monthly rate of stimulant use per 100,000 children
and youth. Following an initial immediate decline of 60.1 individuals
per 100,000 (95% confidence interval \[CI\] - 99.0 to - 21.2), the
monthly rate of stimulant dispensing increased by 11.8 individuals per
100,000 (95% CI 10.0-13.6), with the greatest increases in trend
observed among females, individuals in the highest income
neighbourhoods, and those aged 20 to 24. Observed rates were between
3.9% (95% CI 1.7-6.2%) and 36.9% (95% CI 34.3-39.5%) higher than
predicted among females from June 2020 onward and between 7.1% (95% CI
4.2-10.0%) and 50.7% (95% CI 47.0-54.4%) higher than expected among
individuals aged 20-24 from May 2020 onward. Additional research is
needed to ascertain the appropriateness of stimulant use and to develop
strategies supporting children and youth with ADHD during future periods
of long-term stressors.

<td style="text-align:left;">
Eating disorders disproportionally affect children and youth, however,
literature investigating long-term trends of eating disorder
hospitalizations among children and youth in Canada is limited. We
conducted a retrospective surveillance study, examining eating disorder
hospitalizations among children and youth in Canada, from 2010 to 2022,
by sex, age group, geography and eating disorder diagnosis. More than
half of eating disorder hospitalizations examined during our study
period were first-time hospitalizations. The most common eating disorder
diagnoses were anorexia nervosa, followed by unspecified eating
disorders. Youth had higher rates of eating disorders compared to
younger children and females had higher rates compared to males. In
Canada, rates of pediatric eating disorder hospitalizations increased
during the pandemic. These results emphasize the need for continued
surveillance to monitor how ED hospitalizations evolve post-pandemic, as
well as prioritizing early intervention and treatment to help reduce the
number of children and youth requiring hospitalization.

Access to Specialized Care Across the Lifespan in Tetralogy of Fallot.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Individuals living with tetralogy of Fallot require lifelong specialized
congenital heart disease care to monitor for and manage potential late
complications. However, access to cardiology care remains a challenge
for many patients, as does access to mental health services, dental
care, obstetrical care, and other specialties required by this
population. Inequities in health care access were highlighted by the
COVID-19 pandemic and continue to exist. Paradoxically, many social
factors influence an individual’s need for care, yet inadvertently
restrict access to it. These include sex and gender, being a member of a
racial or ethnic historically excluded group, lower educational
attainment, lower socioeconomic status, living remotely from tertiary
care centres, transportation difficulties, inadequate health insurance,
occupational instability, and prior experiences with discrimination in
the health care setting. These factors may coexist and have compounding
effects. In addition, many patients believe that they are cured and
unaware of the need for specialized follow-up. For these reasons, lapses
in care are common, particularly around the time of transfer from
paediatric to adult care. The lack of trained health care professionals
for adults with congenital heart disease presents an additional barrier,
even in higher income countries. This review summarizes challenges
regarding access to multiple domains of specialized care for individuals
with tetralogy of Fallot, with a focus on the impact of social
determinants of health. Specific recommendations to improve access to
care within Canadian and American systems are offered.

Cardiac Biomarkers Aid in Differentiation of Kawasaki Disease from
Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Associated with COVID-19.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Kawasaki disease (KD) and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children
(MIS-C) associated with COVID-19 show clinical overlap and both lack
definitive diagnostic testing, making differentiation challenging. We
sought to determine how cardiac biomarkers might differentiate KD from
MIS-C. The International Kawasaki Disease Registry enrolled
contemporaneous KD and MIS-C pediatric patients from 42 sites from
January 2020 through June 2022. The study population included 118 KD
patients who met American Heart Association KD criteria and compared
them to 946 MIS-C patients who met 2020 Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention case definition. All included patients had at least one
measurement of amino-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide
(NTproBNP) or cardiac troponin I (TnI), and echocardiography. Regression
analyses were used to determine associations between cardiac biomarker
levels, diagnosis, and cardiac involvement. Higher NTproBNP (≥ 1500
ng/L) and TnI (≥ 20 ng/L) at presentation were associated with MIS-C
versus KD with specificity of 77 and 89%, respectively. Higher biomarker
levels were associated with shock and intensive care unit admission;
higher NTproBNP was associated with longer hospital length of stay.
Lower left ventricular ejection fraction, more pronounced for MIS-C, was
also associated with higher biomarker levels. Coronary artery
involvement was not associated with either biomarker. Higher NTproBNP
and TnI levels are suggestive of MIS-C versus KD and may be clinically
useful in their differentiation. Consideration might be given to their
inclusion in the routine evaluation of both conditions.

Anxiety and watching the war in Ukraine.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
On 24 February 2022, Russia attacked Ukraine. Millions of people tuned
into social media to watch the war. Media exposure to disasters and
large-scale violence can precipitate anxiety resulting in intrusive
thoughts. This research investigates factors related to anxiety while
watching the war. Since the war began during the ongoing coronavirus
pandemic, threat from COVID-19 is seen as a predictor of anxiety when
watching the war. A theoretical model is put forward where the outcome
was anxiety when watching the war, and predictors were self-reported
interference of watching the war with one’s studies or work, gender,
worry about the war, self-efficacy and coronavirus threat. Data were
collected online with independent samples of university students from
two European countries close to Ukraine, Germany (n = 348) and Finland
(n = 228), who filled out an anonymous questionnaire. Path analysis was
used to analyse the data. Findings showed that the model was an
acceptable fit to the data in each sample, and standardised regression
coefficients indicated that anxiety, when watching the war, increased
with interference, war worry and coronavirus threat, and decreased with
self-efficacy. Women reported more anxiety when watching the war than
men. Implications of the results are discussed.

Exploring the lived experiences of participants and facilitators of an

</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has placed incredible demands on
healthcare workers (HCWs) and adversely impacted their well-being.
Throughout the pandemic, organizations have sought to implement brief
and flexible mental health interventions to better support employees.
Few studies have explored HCWs’ lived experiences of participating in
brief, online mindfulness programming during the pandemic using
qualitative methodologies. To address this gap, we conducted
semi-structured interviews with HCWs and program facilitators (n = 13)
who participated in an online, four-week, mindfulness-based intervention
program. The goals of this study were to: (1) understand how
participants experienced work during the pandemic; (2) understand how
the rapid switch to online life impacted program delivery and how
participants experienced the mindfulness program; and (3) describe the
role of the mindfulness program in supporting participants’ mental
health and well-being. We utilized interpretive phenomenological
analysis (IPA) to elucidate participants’ and facilitators’ rich and
meaningful lived experiences and identified patterns of experiences
through a cross-case analysis. This resulted in four main themes: (1)
changing environments; (2) snowball of emotions; (3) connection and
disconnection; and (4) striving for resilience. Findings from this study
highlight strategies for organizations to create and support wellness
programs for HCWs in times of public health crises. These include
improving social connection in virtual care settings, providing
professional development and technology training for HCWs to adapt to
rapid environmental changes, and recognizing the difference between
emotions and emotional states in HCWs involved in mindfulness-based
programs.

Evaluating fluvoxamine for the outpatient treatment of COVID-19: A
systematic review and meta-analysis.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials
(RCTs) aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
fluvoxamine for the outpatient management of COVID-19. We conducted this
review in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Literature
searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, International Pharmaceutical
Abstracts, CINAHL, Web of Science, and CENTRAL up to 14 September 2023.
Outcomes included incidence of hospitalisation, healthcare utilization
(emergency room visits and/or hospitalisation), mortality, supplemental
oxygen and mechanical ventilation requirements, serious adverse events
(SAEs) and non-adherence. Fluvoxamine 100 mg twice a day was associated
with reductions in the risk of hospitalisation (risk ratio \[RR\] 0.75,
95% confidence interval \[CI\] 0.58-0.97; I 2 = 0%) and reductions in
the risk of healthcare utilization (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53-0.86; I 2 =
0%). While no increased SAEs were observed, fluvoxamine 100 mg twice a
day was associated with higher treatment non-adherence compared to
placebo (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.22-2.14; I 2 = 53%). In subgroup analyses,
fluvoxamine reduced healthcare utilization in outpatients with BMI ≥30
kg/m2 , but not in those with lower BMIs. While fluvoxamine offers
potential benefits in reducing healthcare utilization, its efficacy may
be most pronounced in high-risk patient populations. The observed
non-adherence rates highlight the need for better patient education and
counselling. Future investigations should reassess trial endpoints to
include outcomes relating to post-COVID sequelaes. Registration: This
review was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023463829).

As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, community pharmacies adapted rapidly
to broaden and adjust the services they were providing to patients,
while coping with severe pressure on supply chains and constrained

impact on the medication incidents reported by pharmacists. Results
indicate that Canadian pharmacies were able to sustain such stress while
maintaining comparable safety levels. At the same time, it appears that
some risk factors that were either ignored or not meaningful in the past
started to be reported, suggesting that community pharmacists are now
aware of a larger set of contributing factors that can lead to
medication incidents, notably for medication incidents that can lead to
harm.

Association of SARS-CoV-2 infection with neurological impairments in
pediatric population: A systematic review.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Neurological manifestations have been widely reported in adults with
COVID-19, yet the extent of involvement among the pediatric population
is currently poorly characterized. The objective of our systematic
review is to evaluate the association of SARS-CoV-2 infection with
neurological symptoms and neuroimaging manifestations in the pediatric
population. A literature search of Cochrane Library; EBSCO CINAHL;
Global Index Medicus; OVID AMED, Embase, Medline, PsychINFO; and Scopus
was conducted in accordance with the Peer Review of Electronic Search
Strategies form (October 1, 2019 to March 15, 2022). Studies were
included if they reported (1) COVID-19-associated neurological symptoms
and neuroimaging manifestations in individuals aged &lt;18 years with a
confirmed, first SARS-CoV-2 infection and were (2) peer-reviewed.
Full-text reviews of 222 retrieved articles were performed, along with
subsequent reference searches. A total of 843 no-duplicate records were
retrieved. Of the 19 identified studies, there were ten retrospective
observational studies, seven case series, one case report, and one
prospective cohort study. A total of 6985 individuals were included,
where 12.8% (n = 892) of hospitalized patients experienced
neurocognitive impairments which includes: 1) neurological symptoms (n =
294 of 892, 33.0%), 2) neurological syndromes and neuroimaging
abnormalities (n = 223 of 892, 25.0%), and 3) other phenomena (n = 233
of 892, 26.1%). Based on pediatric-specific cohorts, children
experienced more drowsiness (7.3% vs. 1.3%) and muscle weakness (7.3%
vs. 6.3%) as opposed to adolescents. Agitation or irritability was
observed more in children (7.3%) than infants (1.3%). Our findings
revealed a high prevalence of immune-mediated patterns of disease among
COVID-19 positive pediatric patients with neurocognitive abnormalities.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the rate of primary care visits

</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in the prevalence of
substance use presentations. This study aims to assess the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on the rate of primary care visits for substance use
including tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use among primary care
patients in Ontario, Canada. Diagnostic and service fee code data were
collected from a longitudinal cohort of family medicine patients during
pre-pandemic (March 14, 2019-March 13, 2020) and pandemic periods (March
14, 2020-March 13, 2021). Generalized linear models were used to compare
the rate of substance-use related visits pre-pandemic and during the
pandemic. The effects of demographic characteristics including age, sex,
and income quintile were also assessed. Relative to the pre-pandemic
period, patients were less likely to have a primary care visit during
the pandemic for tobacco-use related reasons (OR = 0.288, 95% CI
\[0.270-0.308\]), and for alcohol-use related reasons (OR = 0.851, 95%
CI \[0.780-0.929\]). In contrast, patients were more likely to have a
primary care visit for other drug-use related reasons (OR = 1.150, 95%
CI \[1.080-1.225\]). In the face of a known increase in substance use
during the COVID-19 pandemic, a decrease in substance use-related
primary care visits likely represents an unmet need for this patient
population. This study highlights the importance of continued research
in the field of substance use, especially in periods of heightened
vulnerability such as during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions for controlling the

</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Disease spread can be affected by pharmaceutical interventions (such as
vaccination) and non-pharmaceutical interventions (such as physical
distancing, mask-wearing and contact tracing). Understanding the
relationship between disease dynamics and human behaviour is a
significant factor to controlling infections. In this work, we propose a
compartmental epidemiological model for studying how the infection
dynamics of COVID-19 evolves for people with different levels of social
distancing, natural immunity and vaccine-induced immunity. Our model
recreates the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Ontario up to
December 2021. Our results indicate that people change their behaviour
based on the disease dynamics and mitigation measures. Specifically,
they adopt more protective behaviour when mandated social distancing
measures are in effect, typically concurrent with a high number of
infections. They reduce protective behaviour when vaccination coverage
is high or when mandated contact reduction measures are relaxed,
typically concurrent with a reduction of infections. We demonstrate that
waning of infection and vaccine-induced immunity are important for
reproducing disease transmission in autumn 2021.

Dissecting the heterogeneity of “in the wild” stress from multimodal
sensor data.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Stress is associated with numerous chronic health conditions, both
mental and physical. However, the heterogeneity of these associations at
the individual level is poorly understood. While data generated from
individuals in their day-to-day lives “in the wild” may best represent
the heterogeneity of stress, gathering these data and separating signals
from noise is challenging. In this work, we report findings from a major
data collection effort using Digital Health Technologies (DHTs) and
frontline healthcare workers. We provide insights into stress “in the
wild”, by using robust methods for its identification from multimodal
data and quantifying its heterogeneity. Here we analyze data from the
Stress and Recovery in Frontline COVID-19 Workers study following 365
frontline healthcare workers for 4-6 months using wearable devices and
smartphone app-based measures. Causal discovery is used to learn how the
causal structure governing an individual’s self-reported symptoms and
physiological features from DHTs differs between non-stress and
potential stress states. Our methods uncover robust representations of
potential stress states across a population of frontline healthcare
workers. These representations reveal high levels of inter- and
intra-individual heterogeneity in stress. We leverage multiple stress
definitions that span different modalities (from subjective to
physiological) to obtain a comprehensive view of stress, as these
differing definitions rarely align in time. We show that these different
stress definitions can be robustly represented as changes in the
underlying causal structure on and off stress for individuals. This
study is an important step toward better understanding potential
underlying processes generating stress in individuals.

disenfranchised FSWs reducing access to healthcare, decreasing income
and increasing sexual, physical, and financial abuse by clients and law
enforcement. Due to the customer-facing nature of their work, sex
workers were hit hard by the COVID-19 restrictions. FSWs experienced
poor mental health and strained interpersonal relationships. To cope
they skipped meals, reduced alcohol use and smoking, started small
businesses to supplement sex work or relocated to their rural homes.
Interventions that ensure continuity of access to health services,
prevent exploitation, and ensure the social and economic protection of
FSWs during times of economic strain are required.

Telemedicine-Based Cognitive Examinations During COVID-19 and Beyond:
Perspective of the Massachusetts General Hospital Behavioral Neurology
&amp; Neuropsychiatry Group.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Telehealth and telemedicine have encountered explosive growth since the
beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in increased access to
care for patients located far from medical centers and clinics.
Subspecialty clinicians in behavioral neurology &amp; neuropsychiatry
(BNNP) have implemented the use of telemedicine platforms to perform
cognitive examinations that were previously office based. In this
perspective article, BNNP clinicians at Massachusetts General Hospital
(MGH) describe their experience performing cognitive examinations via
telemedicine. The article reviews the goals, prerequisites, advantages,
and potential limitations of performing a video- or telephone-based
telemedicine cognitive examination. The article shares the approaches
used by MGH BNNP clinicians to examine cognitive and behavioral areas,
such as orientation, attention and executive functions, language, verbal
learning and memory, visual learning and memory, visuospatial function,
praxis, and abstract abilities, as well as to survey for
neuropsychiatric symptoms and assess activities of daily living.
Limitations of telemedicine-based cognitive examinations include limited
access to and familiarity with telecommunication technologies on the
patient side, limitations of the technology itself on the clinician
side, and the limited psychometric validation of virtual assessments.
Therefore, an in-person examination with a BNNP clinician or a formal
in-person neuropsychological examination with a neuropsychologist may be
recommended. Overall, this article emphasizes the use of standardized
cognitive and behavioral assessment instruments that are either in the
public domain or, if copyrighted, are nonproprietary and do not require
a fee to be used by the practicing BNNP clinician.

The COVID-19 pandemic has mandated a re-imagination of how healthcare is

person-centred care and advancing population health while increasing
capacity, access and equity in the healthcare system. These goals can be
achieved through healthcare integration. In 2019, the University Health
Network (UHN), a consortium of four quaternary care hospitals in
Ontario, Canada, established the first stage of a pilot program to
increase healthcare integration at the institutional level and
vertically with other primary, secondary and tertiary institutions in
the Ontario healthcare system. Implementation of the program was
accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic and demonstrated how healthcare
integration improves person-centred care and population health;
therefore serving as the foundation for a health system response for the
COVID-19 pandemic recovery and beyond.

Long-term care transitions during a global pandemic: Planning and

Ontario, Canada.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
The COVID-19 pandemic appears to have shifted the care trajectories of
many residents and care partners in Ontario who considered leaving LTC
to live in the community for a portion or the duration of the pandemic.
This type of care transition-from LTC to home care-was highly uncommon
prior to the pandemic, therefore we know relatively little about the
planning and decision-making involved. The aim of this study was to
describe who was involved in LTC to home care transitions in Ontario
during the COVID-19 pandemic, to what extent, and the factors that
guided their decision-making. A qualitative description study involving
semi-structured interviews with 32 residents, care partners and health
professionals was conducted. Transition decisions were largely made by
care partners, with varied input from residents or health professionals.
Stakeholders considered seven factors, previously identified in a
scoping review, when making their transition decisions: (a)
institutional priorities and requirements; (b) resources; (c) knowledge;
(d) risk; (e) group structure and dynamic; (f) health and support needs;
and (g) personality preferences and beliefs. Participants’ emotional
responses to the pandemic also influenced the perceived need to pursue a
care transition. The findings of this research provide insights towards
the planning required to support LTC to home care transitions, and the
many challenges that arise during decision-making.

A synthesis of evidence for policy from behavioural science during
COVID-19.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Scientific evidence regularly guides policy decisions1, with behavioural
science increasingly part of this process2. In April 2020, an
influential paper3 proposed 19 policy recommendations (‘claims’)
detailing how evidence from behavioural science could contribute to
efforts to reduce impacts and end the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we assess
747 pandemic-related research articles that empirically investigated
those claims. We report the scale of evidence and whether evidence
supports them to indicate applicability for policymaking. Two
independent teams, involving 72 reviewers, found evidence for 18 of 19
claims, with both teams finding evidence supporting 16 (89%) of those 18
claims. The strongest evidence supported claims that anticipated
culture, polarization and misinformation would be associated with policy
effectiveness. Claims suggesting trusted leaders and positive social
norms increased adherence to behavioural interventions also had strong
empirical support, as did appealing to social consensus or bipartisan
agreement. Targeted language in messaging yielded mixed effects and
there were no effects for highlighting individual benefits or protecting
others. No available evidence existed to assess any distinct differences
in effects between using the terms ‘physical distancing’ and ‘social
distancing’. Analysis of 463 papers containing data showed generally
large samples; 418 involved human participants with a mean of 16,848
(median of 1,699). That statistical power underscored improved
suitability of behavioural science research for informing policy
decisions. Furthermore, by implementing a standardized approach to
evidence selection and synthesis, we amplify broader implications for
advancing scientific evidence in policy formulation and prioritization.

Delivering health promotion during school closures in public health
emergencies: building consensus among Canadian experts.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
School-based health promotion is drastically disrupted by school
closures during public health emergencies or natural disasters. Climate
change will likely accelerate the frequency of these events and hence
school closures. We identified innovative health promotion practices
delivered during COVID-19 school closures and sought consensus among
education experts on their future utility. Fifteen health promotion
practices delivered in 87 schools across Alberta, Canada during COVID-19
school closures in Spring 2020, were grouped into: ‘awareness of healthy
lifestyle behaviours and mental wellness’, ‘virtual events’, ‘tangible
supports’ and ‘school-student-family connectedness’. Two expert panels
(23 school-level practitioners and 20 decision-makers at the school
board and provincial levels) rated practices on feasibility,
acceptability, reach, effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and other
criteria in three rounds of online Delphi surveys. Consensus was reached
if 70% or more participants (strongly) agreed with a statement,
(strongly) disagreed or neither. Participants agreed all practices
require planning, preparation and training before implementation and
additional staff time and most require external support or partnerships.
Participants rated ‘awareness of healthy lifestyle behaviours and mental
wellness’ and ‘virtual events’ as easy and quick to implement, effective
and cost-effective, sustainable, easy to integrate into curriculum, well
received by students and teachers, benefit school culture and require no
additional funding/resources. ‘Tangible supports’ (equipment, food) and
‘school-student-family connectedness’ were rated as most likely to reach
vulnerable students and families. Health promotion practices presented
herein can inform emergency preparedness plans and are critical to
ensuring health remains a priority during public health emergencies and
natural disasters.

Risk of COVID-19 death for people with a pre-existing cancer diagnosis
prior to COVID-19-vaccination: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
While previous reviews found a positive association between pre-existing
cancer diagnosis and COVID-19-related death, most early studies did not
distinguish long-term cancer survivors from those recently
diagnosed/treated, nor adjust for important confounders including age.
We aimed to consolidate higher-quality evidence on risk of
COVID-19-related death for people with recent/active cancer (compared to
people without) in the pre-COVID-19-vaccination period. We searched the
WHO COVID-19 Global Research Database (20 December 2021), and Medline
and Embase (10 May 2023). We included studies adjusting for age and sex,
and providing details of cancer status. Risk-of-bias assessment was
based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Pooled adjusted odds or risk ratios
(aORs, aRRs) or hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%
CIs) were calculated using generic inverse-variance random-effects
models. Random-effects meta-regressions were used to assess associations
between effect estimates and time since cancer diagnosis/treatment. Of
23 773 unique title/abstract records, 39 studies were eligible for
inclusion (2 low, 17 moderate, 20 high risk of bias). Risk of
COVID-19-related death was higher for people with active or recently
diagnosed/treated cancer (general population: aOR = 1.48, 95% CI:
1.36-1.61, I2 = 0; people with COVID-19: aOR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.41-1.77,
I2 = 0.58; inpatients with COVID-19: aOR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.34-2.06, I2 =
0.98). Risks were more elevated for lung (general population: aOR = 3.4,
95% CI: 2.4-4.7) and hematological cancers (general population: aOR =
2.13, 95% CI: 1.68-2.68, I2 = 0.43), and for metastatic cancers.
Meta-regression suggested risk of COVID-19-related death decreased with
time since diagnosis/treatment, for example, for any/solid cancers,
fitted aOR = 1.55 (95% CI: 1.37-1.75) at 1 year and aOR = 0.98 (95% CI:
0.80-1.20) at 5 years post-cancer diagnosis/treatment. In conclusion,
before COVID-19-vaccination, risk of COVID-19-related death was higher
for people with recent cancer, with risk depending on cancer type and
time since diagnosis/treatment.

Awareness of RNA-based therapies has increased after the widespread
adoption of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19
pandemic. These mRNA vaccines had a significant impact on reducing lung
disease and mortality. They highlighted the potential for rapid
development of RNA-based therapies and advances in nanoparticle delivery
systems. Along with the rapid advancement in RNA biology, including the
description of noncoding RNAs as major products of the genome, this
success presents an opportunity to highlight the potential of RNA as a
therapeutic modality. Here, we review the expanding compendium of
RNA-based therapies, their mechanisms of action and examples of
application in the lung. The airways provide a convenient conduit for
drug delivery to the lungs with decreased systemic exposure. This review
will also describe other delivery methods, including local delivery to
the pleura and delivery vehicles that can target the lung after systemic
administration, each providing access options that are advantageous for
a specific application. We present clinical trials of RNA-based therapy
in lung disease and potential areas for future directions. This review
aims to provide an overview that will bring together researchers and
clinicians to advance this burgeoning field.

</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the
SARS-CoV-2 virus, has rapidly evolved since late 2019, due to highly
transmissible Omicron variants. While most Canadian paramedics have
received COVID-19 vaccination, the optimal ongoing vaccination strategy
is unclear. We investigated neutralizing antibody (NtAb) response
against wild-type (WT) Wuhan Hu-1 and Omicron BA.4/5 lineages based on
the number of doses and past SARS-CoV-2 infection, at 18 months
post-initial vaccination (with a Wuhan Hu-1 platform mRNA vaccine
\[BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273\]). Demographic information, previous COVID-19
vaccination, infection history, and blood samples were collected from
paramedics 18 months post-initial mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose. Outcome
measures were ACE2 percent inhibition against Omicron BA.4/5 and WT
antigens. We compared outcomes based on number of vaccine doses (two
vs. three) and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection status, using the
Mann-Whitney U test. Of 657 participants, the median age was 40 years
(IQR 33-50) and 251 (42 %) were females. Overall, median percent
inhibition to BA.4/5 and WT was 71.61 % (IQR 39.44-92.82) and 98.60 %
(IQR 83.07-99.73), respectively. Those with a past SARS-CoV-2 infection
had a higher median percent inhibition to BA.4/5 and WT, when compared
to uninfected individuals overall and when stratified by two or three
vaccine doses. When comparing two vs. three WT vaccine doses among
SARS-CoV-2 negative participants, we did not detect a difference in
BA.4/5 percent inhibition, but there was a difference in WT percent
inhibition. Among those with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection(s), when
comparing two vs. three WT vaccine doses, there was no observed
difference between groups. These findings demonstrate that additional

The Fragility of Scientific Rigour and Integrity in “Sped up Science”:
Research Misconduct, Bias, and Hype and in the COVID-19 Pandemic.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
During the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic, preclinical and
clinical research were sped up and scaled up in both the public and
private sectors and in partnerships between them. This resulted in some
extraordinary advances, but it also raised a range of issues regarding
the ethics, rigour, and integrity of scientific research, academic
publication, and public communication. Many of the failures of
scientific rigour and integrity that occurred during the pandemic were
exacerbated by the rush to generate, disseminate, and implement research
findings, which not only created opportunities for unscrupulous actors
but also compromised the methodological, peer review, and advisory
processes that would usually identify sub-standard research and prevent
compromised clinical or policy-level decisions. While it would be
tempting to attribute these failures of science and its translation
solely to the “unprecedented” circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic,
the reality is that they preceded the pandemic and will continue to
arise once it is over. Existing strategies for promoting scientific
rigour and integrity need to be made more rigorous, better integrated
into research training and institutional cultures, and made more
sophisticated. They might also need to be modified or supplemented with
other strategies that are fit for purpose not only in public health
emergencies but in any research that is sped-up and scaled up to address
urgent unmet medical needs.

NanoBubble-Mediated Oxygenation: Elucidating the Underlying Molecular

</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Worldwide, hypoxia-related conditions, including cancer, COVID-19, and
neuro-degenerative diseases, often lead to multi-organ failure and
significant mortality. Oxygen, crucial for cellular function, becomes
scarce as levels drop below 10 mmHg (&lt;2% O2), triggering
mitochondrial dysregulation and activating hypoxia-induced factors
(HiFs). Herein, oxygen nanobubbles (OnB), an emerging versatile oxygen
delivery platform, offer a novel approach to address hypoxia-related
pathologies. This review explores OnB oxygen delivery strategies and
systems, including diffusion, ultrasound, photodynamic, and
pH-responsive nanobubbles. It delves into the nanoscale mechanisms of
OnB, elucidating their role in mitochondrial metabolism (TFAM,
PGC1alpha), hypoxic responses (HiF-1alpha), and their interplay in
chronic pathologies including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders,
amongst others. By understanding these dynamics and underlying
mechanisms, this article aims to contribute to our accruing knowledge of
OnB and the developing potential in ameliorating hypoxia- and metabolic
stress-related conditions and fostering innovative therapies.

According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s National
Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, the cervical cancer
screening rate dropped by 84% soon after the declaration of the COVID-19
pandemic. The challenges facing cervical cancer screening were largely
attributed to the required in-person nature of the screening process and
the measures implemented to control the spread of the virus. While the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer screening is well-documented
in high-income countries, less is known about the low- and middle-income
countries that bear 90% of the global burden of cervical cancer deaths.
In this paper, we aim to offer a comprehensive view of the impact of
COVID-19 on cervical cancer screening in LMICs. Using our study,
“Prevention of Cervical Cancer in India through Self-Sampling” (PCCIS),
as a case example, we present the challenges COVID-19 has exerted on

of COVID-19 Patients.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
This study aims to explore the differences in the psychological impact
of COVID-19 on physicians, specifically those who volunteered or were
contractually obligated to provide care for COVID-19 patients. While
previous research has predominantly focused on the physical health
consequences and risk of exposure for healthcare workers, limited
attention has been given to their work conditions. This sample comprised
300 physicians, with 68.0% of them men (mean age = 54.67 years; SD =
12.44; range: 23-73). Participants completed measurements including the
State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Coping Inventory in Stressful
Situations (CISS), and Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (C.A.S.). Pearson’s
correlations were conducted to examine the relationships between the
variables of interest. This study employed multivariate models to test
the differences between work conditions: (a) involvement in COVID-19
patient care, (b) volunteering for COVID-19 patient management, (c)
contractual obligation to care for COVID-19 patients, and (d) COVID-19
contraction in the workplace. The results of the multivariate analysis
revealed that direct exposure to COVID-19 patients and contractual
obligation to care for them significantly predicted state anxiety and
dysfunctional coping strategies \[Wilks’ Lambda = 0.917 F = 3.254 p &lt;
0.001\]. In contrast, volunteering or being affected by COVID-19 did not
emerge as significant predictors for anxiety or dysfunctional coping
strategies. The findings emphasize the importance of addressing the
psychological well-being of physicians involved in COVID-19 care and
highlight the need for targeted interventions to support their mental
and occupational health.

Enhancing the value of digital health tools for mental health
help-seeking in Canadian transitional aged youth during the pandemic:
Qualitative study.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
While the COVID-19 pandemic has greatly exacerbated the mental health
challenges of transition-aged youth (TAY) between 17 and 29 years old,
it has also led to the rapid adoption of digital tools for mental health
help-seeking and treatment. However, to date, there has been limited
work focusing on how this shift has impacted perceptions, needs and
challenges of this population in using digital tools. The current study
aims to understand their perspectives on mental health help-seeking
during the pandemic and emerging issues related to digital tools (e.g.,
digital health equity, inclusivity). A total of 16 TAY were invited from
three post-secondary institutions in the Greater Toronto Area. A total
of two streams of focus groups were held and participants were invited
to share their perceptions, needs and experiences. Five main themes were
identified: 1) Helpfulness of a centralized resource encompassing a
variety of diverse mental health supports help-seeking; 2) The impact of
the shift to online mental health support on the use of informal
supports; 3) Digital tool affordability and availability; 4) Importance
of inclusivity for digital tools; and 5) Need for additional support for
mental health seeking and digital tool navigation. Future work should
examine how these needs can be addressed through new and existing
digital mental health help-seeking tools for TAY.

Combinatorial design of ionizable lipid nanoparticles for
muscle-selective mRNA delivery with minimized off-target effects.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) pivotal to the success of COVID-19
mRNA (messenger RNA) vaccines hold substantial promise for expanding the
landscape of mRNA-based therapies. Nevertheless, the risk of mRNA
delivery to off-target tissues highlights the necessity for LNPs with
enhanced tissue selectivity. The intricate nature of biological systems
and inadequate knowledge of lipid structure-activity relationships
emphasize the significance of high-throughput methods to produce
chemically diverse lipid libraries for mRNA delivery screening. Here, we
introduce a streamlined approach for the rapid design and synthesis of
combinatorial libraries of biodegradable ionizable lipids. This led to
the identification of iso-A11B5C1, an ionizable lipid uniquely apt for
muscle-specific mRNA delivery. It manifested high transfection
efficiencies in muscle tissues, while significantly diminishing
off-targeting in organs like the liver and spleen. Moreover, iso-A11B5C1
also exhibited reduced mRNA transfection potency in lymph nodes and
antigen-presenting cells, prompting investigation into the influence of
direct immune cell transfection via LNPs on mRNA vaccine effectiveness.
In comparison with SM-102, while iso-A11B5C1’s limited immune
transfection attenuated its ability to elicit humoral immunity, it
remained highly effective in triggering cellular immune responses after
intramuscular administration, which is further corroborated by its
strong therapeutic performance as cancer vaccine in a melanoma model.
Collectively, our study not only enriches the high-throughput toolkit
for generating tissue-specific ionizable lipids but also encourages a
reassessment of prevailing paradigms in mRNA vaccine design. This study
encourages rethinking of mRNA vaccine design principles, suggesting that
achieving high immune cell transfection might not be the sole criterion
for developing effective mRNA vaccines.

multiple mammalian species, including skunks, foxes, bears, mink, seals,
porpoises, sea lions, and dolphins. Viruses with mammalian adaptations
such as the mutations PB2-E627K, E627V, and D701N were found in the

Building solidarity during COVID-19 and HIV/AIDS.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
While the WHO, public health experts, and political leaders have
referenced solidarity as an important part of our responses to COVID-19,
I consider how we build solidarity during pandemics in order to improve
the effectiveness of our responses. I use Prainsack and Buyx’s
definition of solidarity, which highlights three different tiers: (1)
interpersonal solidarity, (2) group solidarity, and (3) institutional
solidarity. Each tier of solidarity importantly depends on the actions
and norms established at the lower tiers. Although empathy and
solidarity are distinct moral concepts, I argue that the affective
component of solidarity is important for motivating solidaristic action,
and empathetic accounts of solidarity help us understand how we actually
build solidarity from tier to tier. During pandemics, public health
responses draw on different tiers of solidarity depending on the nature,
scope, and timeline of the pandemic. Therefore, I analyze both COVID-19
and HIV/AIDS using this framework to learn lessons about how solidarity
can more effectively contribute to our ongoing public health responses
during pandemics. Whereas we used institutional solidarity during
COVID-19 in a top-down approach to building solidarity that often
overlooked interpersonal and group solidarity, we used those lower tiers
during HIV/AIDS in a bottom-up approach because governments and public
health institutions were initially unresponsive to the crisis. Thus, we
need to ensure that we have a strong foundation of respect, trust, and
so forth, on which to build solidarity from tier to tier and promote
whichever tiers of solidarity are lacking during a given pandemic to
improve our responses.

A Qualitative Analysis of Medical Student Reflections Following
Participation in a Canadian Radiation Oncology Studentship.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Exposure to radiation oncology in medical school curricula is limited;
thus, mentorship and research opportunities like the Dr. Pamela Catton
Summer Studentship Program attempt to bridge this gap and stimulate
interest in the specialty. In 2021, the studentship was redesigned as
virtual research, mentorship, and case-based discussions due to the
COVID-19 pandemic. This study explores the impact of COVID-19 on the
studentship, on students’ perceptions of the program, and on medical
training and career choice. Fifteen studentship completion essays during
2021-2022 were obtained and anonymized. Thematic analysis was performed
to interpret the essays with NVivo. Two independent reviewers coded the
essays. Themes were established by identifying connections between coded
excerpts. Consensus was achieved through multiple rounds of discussion
and iteratively reviewing each theme. Representative quotes were used to
illustrate the themes. The themes confirmed the studentship was feasible
during the pandemic. Perceived benefits of the program included
mentorship and networking opportunities; gaining practical and
fundamental knowledge in radiation oncology; developing clinical and
research skills; and creating positive attitudes towards radiation
oncology and the humanistic aspect of the field. The studentship
supported medical specialty selection by helping define student values,
shaping perceptions of the specialty, and promoting self-reflection upon
students’ personal needs. This study informs future iterations of the
studentship to promote radiation oncology in Canadian medical school
curricula. It serves as a model for studentships in other specialties
that have limited exposure and similar challenges with medical student
recruitment.

Effect of mode of healthcare delivery on job satisfaction and intention
to quit among nurses in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a major shift in the delivery of
healthcare services with the adoption of care modalities to address the
diverse needs of patients. Besides, nurses, the largest profession in
the healthcare sector, were imposed with challenges caused by the
pandemic that influenced their intention to leave their profession. The
aim of the study was to examine the influence of mode of healthcare
delivery on nurses’ intention to quit job due to lack of satisfaction
during the pandemic in Canada. This cross-sectional study utilized data
from the Health Care Workers’ Experiences During the Pandemic (SHCWEP)
survey, conducted by Statistics Canada, that targeted healthcare workers
aged 18 and over who resided in the ten provinces of Canada during the
COVID-19 pandemic. The main outcome of the study was nurses’ intention
to quit within two years due to lack of job satisfaction. The mode of
healthcare delivery was categorized into; in-person, online, or blended.
Multivariable logistic regression was performed to examine the
association between mode of healthcare delivery and intention to quit
job after adjusting for sociodemographic, job-, and health-related
factors. Analysis for the present study was restricted to 3,430 nurses,
weighted to represent 353,980 Canadian nurses. Intention to quit job,
within the next two years, due to lack of satisfaction was reported by
16.4% of the nurses. Results showed that when compared to participants
who provided in-person healthcare services, those who delivered online
or blended healthcare services were at decreased odds of intention to
quit their job due to lack of job satisfaction (OR = 0.47, 95% CI:
0.43-0.50 and OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.61-0.67, respectively). Findings from
this study can inform interventions and policy reforms to address
nurses’ needs and provide organizational support to enhance their
retention and improve patient care during times of crisis.

Proteomic Evolution from Acute to Post-COVID-19 Conditions.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Many COVID-19 survivors have post-COVID-19 conditions, and females are
at a higher risk. We sought to determine (1) how protein levels change
from acute to post-COVID-19 conditions, (2) whether females have a
plasma protein signature different from that of males, and (3) which
biological pathways are associated with COVID-19 when compared to
restrictive lung disease. We measured protein levels in 74 patients on
the day of admission and at 3 and 6 months after diagnosis. We
determined protein concentrations by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)
using a panel of 269 heavy-labeled peptides. The predicted forced vital
capacity (FVC) and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide
(DLCO) were measured by routine pulmonary function testing. Proteins
associated with six key lipid-related pathways increased from admission
to 3 and 6 months; conversely, proteins related to innate immune
responses and vasoconstriction-related proteins decreased. Multiple
biological functions were regulated differentially between females and
males. Concentrations of eight proteins were associated with FVC, %, and
they together had c-statistics of 0.751 (CI:0.732-0.779); similarly,
concentrations of five proteins had c-statistics of 0.707
(CI:0.676-0.737) for DLCO, %. Lipid biology may drive evolution from
acute to post-COVID-19 conditions, while activation of innate immunity
and vascular regulation pathways decreased over that period.

Multi-method Findings.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Food insecurity (FI) and water insecurity (WI) are linked with HIV
vulnerabilities, yet how these resource insecurities shape HIV
prevention needs is understudied. We assessed associations between FI
and WI and HIV vulnerabilities among urban refugee youth aged 16-24 in
Kampala, Uganda through individual in-depth interviews (IDI) (n = 24),
focus groups (n = 4), and a cross-sectional survey (n = 340) with
refugee youth, and IDI with key informants (n = 15). Quantitative data
was analysed via multivariable logistic and linear regression to assess
associations between FI and WI with: reduced pandemic sexual and
reproductive health (SRH) access; past 3-month transactional sex (TS);
unplanned pandemic pregnancy; condom self-efficacy; and sexual
relationship power (SRP). We applied thematic analytic approaches to
qualitative data. Among survey participants, FI and WI were commonplace
(65% and 47%, respectively) and significantly associated with: reduced
SRH access (WI: adjusted odds ratio \[aOR\]: 1.92, 95% confidence
interval \[CI\]: 1.19-3.08; FI: aOR: 2.31. 95%CI: 1.36-3.93), unplanned
pregnancy (WI: aOR: 2.77, 95%CI: 1.24-6.17; FI: aOR: 2.62, 95%CI:
1.03-6.66), and TS (WI: aOR: 3.09, 95%CI: 1.22-7.89; FI: aOR: 3.51,
95%CI: 1.15-10.73). WI participants reported lower condom self-efficacy
(adjusted β= -3.98, 95%CI: -5.41, -2.55) and lower SRP (adjusted β=
-2.58, 95%CI= -4.79, -0.37). Thematic analyses revealed: (1) contexts of
TS, including survival needs and pandemic impacts; (2) intersectional
HIV vulnerabilities; (3) reduced HIV prevention/care access; and (4)
water insecurity as a co-occurring socio-economic stressor. Multi-method
findings reveal FI and WI are linked with HIV vulnerabilities,
underscoring the need for HIV prevention to address co-occurring
resource insecurities with refugee youth.

A novel multiplex biomarker panel for profiling human acute and chronic
kidney disease.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Acute and chronic kidney disease continues to confer significant
morbidity and mortality in the clinical setting. Despite high prevalence
of these conditions, few validated biomarkers exist to predict kidney
dysfunction. In this study, we utilized a novel kidney multiplex panel
to measure 21 proteins in plasma and urine to characterize the spectrum
of biomarker profiles in kidney disease. Blood and urine samples were
obtained from age-/sex-matched healthy control subjects (HC),
critically-ill COVID-19 patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), and
patients with chronic or end-stage kidney disease (CKD/ESKD). Biomarkers
were measured with a kidney multiplex panel, and results analyzed with
conventional statistics and machine learning. Correlations were examined
between biomarkers and patient clinical and laboratory variables. Median
AKI subject age was 65.5 (IQR 58.5-73.0) and median CKD/ESKD age was
65.0 (IQR 50.0-71.5). Of the CKD/ESKD patients, 76.1% were on
hemodialysis, 14.3% of patients had kidney transplant, and 9.5% had CKD
without kidney replacement therapy. In plasma, 19 proteins were
significantly different in titer between the HC versus AKI versus
CKD/ESKD groups, while NAG and RBP4 were unchanged. TIMP-1 (PPV 1.0, NPV
1.0), best distinguished AKI from HC, and TFF3 (PPV 0.99, NPV 0.89) best
distinguished CKD/ESKD from HC. In urine, 18 proteins were significantly
different between groups except Calbindin, Osteopontin and TIMP-1.
Osteoactivin (PPV 0.95, NPV 0.95) best distinguished AKI from HC, and
β2-microglobulin (PPV 0.96, NPV 0.78) best distinguished CKD/ESKD from
HC. A variety of correlations were noted between patient variables and
either plasma or urine biomarkers. Using a novel kidney multiplex
biomarker panel, together with conventional statistics and machine
learning, we identified unique biomarker profiles in the plasma and
urine of patients with AKI and CKD/ESKD. We demonstrated correlations
between biomarker profiles and patient clinical variables. Our
exploratory study provides biomarker data for future hypothesis driven
research on kidney disease.

Here to stay? Policy changes in alcohol home delivery and “to-go” sales
during and after COVID-19 in the United States.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
During the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, legislative changes
that expanded alcohol home delivery and options for “to-go” alcohol
sales were introduced across the United States to provide economic
relief to establishments and retailers. Using data from the Alcohol
Policy Information System, we examined whether these changes have
persisted beyond the peak phase of the COVID-19 emergency and explored
the implications for public health. Illustration of state-level policy
data reveals that the liberalisation of alcohol delivery and “to-go”
alcohol sales has continued throughout a 2-year period (2020 and 2021),
with indications that many of these changes have or will become
permanent after the pandemic. This raises concerns about inadequate
regulation, particularly in preventing underage access to alcohol, and
ensuing changes in drinking practices. In this commentary, we highlight
the need for rigorous empirical evaluation of the public health impact
of this changing policy landscape and underscore the potential risks
associated with increased alcohol availability, including a
corresponding increase in alcohol-attributable mortality and other
alcohol-related harm, such as domestic violence. Policy makers should
carefully consider public health consequences, whose costs may surpass
short-term economic interests in the long term.

Why Did Home Care Personal Support Service Volumes Drop During the
COVID-19 Pandemic? The Contributions of Client Choice and Personal
Support Worker Availability.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Home care personal support service delivery decreased during the
COVID-19 pandemic, and qualitative studies have suggested many potential
contributors to these reductions. This paper provides insight into the
source (client or provider) of reductions in home care service volumes
early in the pandemic through analysis of a retrospective administrative
dataset from a large provider organization. The percentage of authorized
services not delivered was 17.2% in Wave 1, 12.6% in Wave 2 and 10.5% in
Wave 3, nearing the pre-pandemic baseline of 8.9%. The dominant
contribution to reduced home care service volumes was client-initiated
holds and cancellations, collectively accounting for 99.3% of the
service volume; missed care visits by the provider accounted for 0.7%.
Worker availability also declined due to long-term absences (which
increased 5-fold early in Wave 1 and remained 4× above baseline in Waves
2 and 3); short-term absences rose sharply for 6 early-pandemic weeks,
then dropped below the pre-pandemic baseline. These data reveal that
service volume reductions were primarily driven by client-initiated
holds and cancellations; despite unprecedented decreases in Personal
Support Worker availability, missed care did not increase, indicating
that the decrease in demand was more substantial and occurred earlier
than the decrease in worker availability.

What are COVID-19 Patient Preferences for and Experiences with Virtual
Care? Findings From a Scoping Review.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Virtual care became a routine method for healthcare delivery during the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Patient preferences are
central to delivering patient-centered and high-quality care. The
pandemic challenged healthcare organizations and providers to quickly
deliver safe healthcare to COVID-19 patients. This resulted in varied
implementation of virtual healthcare services. With an increased focus
on remote COVID-19 monitoring, little research has examined patient
experiences with virtual care. This scoping review examined patient
experiences and preferences with virtual care among community-based
self-isolating COVID-19 patients. We identified a paucity of literature
related to patient experiences and preferences regarding virtual care.
Few articles focused on patient experiences and preferences as a primary
outcome. Our research suggests that (1) patients view virtual care
positively and to be feasible to use; (2) patient access to technology
impacts patient satisfaction and experiences; and (3) to enhance the
patient experience, healthcare organizations and providers need to
support patient use of technology and resolve technology-related issues.
When planning virtual care modalities, purposeful consideration of
patient experiences and preferences is needed to deliver quality
patient-centered care.

“A prison is no place for a pandemic”: Canadian prisoners’ collective
action in the time of COVID-19.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Since the onset of COVID-19, social protest has expanded significantly.
Little, however, has been written on prison-led and prison justice
organizing in the wake of the pandemic-particularly in the Canadian
context. This article is a case study of prisoner organizing in Canada
throughout the first 18 months of COVID-19, which draws on qualitative
interviews, media, and documentary analysis. We argue that the pandemic
generated conditions under which the grievances raised by prisoners, and
the strategies through which they were articulated, made possible a
discursive bridge to the anxieties and grievances experienced by those
in the community, thinning the walls of state-imposed societal
exclusion. We demonstrate that prisons are sites of fierce contestation
and are deeply embedded in, rather than separate from, our society. An
important lesson learned from this case study is the need for prison
organizing campaigns to strategically embrace multi-issue framing and
engage in sustained coalition building.

Was Virtual Care as Safe as In-Person Care? Analyzing Patient Outcomes
at Seven and Thirty Days in Ontario during the COVID-19 Pandemic.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
In 2020, almost overnight, the paradigm for healthcare interactions
changed in Ontario. To limit person-to-person transmission of COVID-19,
the norm of in-person interactions shifted to virtual care. While this
shift was part of broader public health measures and an acknowledgment
of patient and societal concerns, it also represented a change in care
modalities that had the potential to affect the quality of care
provided, as well as short- and long-term patient outcomes. While public
policy decisions were being made to moderate the use of virtual care at
the end of the declared pandemic, a thorough analysis of short-term
patient outcomes was needed to quantify the impact of virtual care on
the population of Ontario.

Electronic health information that is easily accessible and shareable
among healthcare providers and their patients can provide substantial
improvements in Canada’s primary care system and population health

Policy Survey of Primary Care Physicians (CIHI 2023) highlights the
views and experiences of primary care doctors in 10 developed countries,
including Canada. The survey covered various topics related to physician
workload, the use of information technology and coordination of care.
While the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to an increased physician
workload that may have impacted the ability to efficiently coordinate
care with other healthcare providers, Canadian family doctors did close
the gap with other countries as 93% of family doctors are now using
electronic medical records (EMRs) in their practices. The CMWF’s 2022
survey revealed challenges faced by Canadian family doctors in their
practices. However, international comparisons provide opportunities to
learn from other countries and build on the implementation of EMRs as

SCARF Genes in COVID-19 and Kidney Disease: A Path to
Comorbidity-Specific Therapies.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has killed ~7 million persons
worldwide. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the most common risk factor
for severe COVID-19 and one that most increases the risk of
COVID-19-related death. Moreover, CKD increases the risk of acute kidney
injury (AKI), and COVID-19 patients with AKI are at an increased risk of
death. However, the molecular basis underlying this risk has not been
well characterized. CKD patients are at increased risk of death from
multiple infections, to which immune deficiency in non-specific host
defenses may contribute. However, COVID-19-associated AKI has specific
molecular features and CKD modulates the local (kidney) and systemic
(lung, aorta) expression of host genes encoding coronavirus-associated
receptors and factors (SCARFs), which SARS-CoV-2 hijacks to enter cells
and replicate. We review the interaction between kidney disease and
COVID-19, including the over 200 host genes that may influence the
severity of COVID-19, and provide evidence suggesting that kidney
disease may modulate the expression of SCARF genes and other key host
genes involved in an effective adaptive defense against coronaviruses.
Given the poor response of certain CKD populations (e.g., kidney
transplant recipients) to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and their suboptimal
outcomes when infected, we propose a research agenda focusing on CKD to
develop the concept of comorbidity-specific targeted therapeutic
approaches to SARS-CoV-2 infection or to future coronavirus infections.

Alexithymia, Burnout, and Hopelessness in a Large Sample of Healthcare
Workers during the Third Wave of COVID-19 in Italy.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
In the present study, we aimed to assess the frequency of and the
relationships between alexithymia, burnout, and hopelessness in a large
sample of healthcare workers (HCWs) during the third wave of COVID-19 in
Italy. Alexithymia was evaluated by the Italian version of the 20-item
Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and its subscales Difficulty in
Identifying Feelings (DIF), Difficulty in Describing Feelings (DDF), and
Externally Oriented Thinking (EOT), burnout was measured with the scales
emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalisation (DP), and personal
accomplishment (PA) of the Maslach Burnout Test (MBI), hopelessness was
measured using the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), and irritability
(IRR), depression (DEP), and anxiety (ANX) were evaluated with the
Italian version of the Irritability’ Depression’ Anxiety Scale (IDA).
This cross-sectional study recruited a sample of 1445 HCWs from a large
urban healthcare facility in Italy from 1 May to 31 June 2021. The
comparison between individuals that were positive (n = 214, 14.8%) or
not for alexithymia (n = 1231, 85.2%), controlling for age, gender, and
working seniority, revealed that positive subjects showed higher scores
on BHS, EE, DP IRR, DEP, ANX, DIF, DDF, and EOT and lower on PA than the
not positive ones (p &lt; 0.001). In the linear regression model, higher
working seniority as well as higher EE, IRR, DEP, ANX, and DDF scores
and lower PA were associated with higher hopelessness. In conclusion,
increased hopelessness was associated with higher burnout and
alexithymia. Comprehensive strategies should be implemented to support
HCWs’ mental health and mitigate the negative consequences of
alexithymia, burnout, and hopelessness.

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Staging Oncologic PET/CT Imaging and
Patient Outcome in a Public Healthcare Context: Overview and Follow Up
of the First Two Years of the Pandemic.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the diagnosis, staging
and outcome of a selected population throughout the first two years of
the pandemic, we evaluated oncology patients undergoing PET/CT at our
institution. A retrospective population of lung cancer, melanoma,
lymphoma and head and neck cancer patients staged using PET/CT during
the first 6 months of the years 2019, 2020 and 2021 were included for
analysis. The year in which the PET was performed was our exposure
variable, and our two main outcomes were stage at the time of the PET/CT
and overall survival (OS). A total of 1572 PET/CTs were performed for
staging purposes during the first 6 months of 2019, 2020 and 2021. The
median age was 66 (IQR 16), and 915 (58%) were males. The most prevalent
staged cancer was lung cancer (643, 41%). The univariate analysis of
staging at PET/CT and OS by year of PET/CT were not significantly
different. The multivariate Cox regression of non-COVID-19 significantly
different variables at univariate analysis and the year of PET/CT
determined that lung cancer (HR 1.76 CI95 1.23-2.53, p &lt; 0.05), stage
III (HR 3.63 CI95 2.21-5.98, p &lt; 0.05), stage IV (HR 11.06 CI95
7.04-17.36, p &lt; 0.05) and age at diagnosis (HR 1.04 CI95 1.02-1.05, p
&lt; 0.05) had increased risks of death. We did not find significantly
higher stages or reduced OS when assessing the year PET/CT was
performed. Furthermore, OS was not significantly modified by the year
patients were staged, even when controlled for non-COVID-19 significant
variables (age, type of cancer, stage and gender).

Implementing digital emergency medicine: a call to action.

<td style="text-align:left;">
As digital technologies continue to impact medicine, emergency medicine
providers have an opportunity to work together to harness these
technologies and shape their implementation within our healthcare
system. COVID-19 and the rapid scaling of virtual care provide an
example of how profoundly emergency medicine can be affected by digital
technology, both positively and negatively. This example also
strengthens the case for why EM providers can help lead the integration
of digital technologies within our broader healthcare system. As virtual
care becomes a permanent fixture of our system, and other technologies
such as AI and wearables break into Canadian healthcare, more advocacy,
research, and health system leadership will be required to best leverage
these tools. This paper outlines the purpose and outputs of the newly
founded CAEP Digital Emergency Medicine (DigEM) Committee, with the hope
of inspiring further interest amongst CAEP members and creating
opportunities to collaborate with other organizations within CAEP and
across EM groups nationwide.

A review of the reliability of remote neuropsychological assessment.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
The provision of clinical neuropsychological services has predominately
been undertaken by way of standardized administration in a face-to-face
setting. Interpretation of psychometric findings in this context is
dependent on the use of normative comparison. When the standardization
in which such psychometric measures are employed deviates from how they
were employed in the context of the development of its associated norms,
one is left to question the reliability and hence, validity of any such
findings and in turn, diagnostic decision making. In light of the
current COVID-19 pandemic and resultant social distancing direction,
face-to-face neuropsychological assessment has been challenging to
undertake. As such, remote (i.e., virtual) neuropsychological assessment
has become an obvious solution. Here, and before the results from remote
neuropsychological assessment can be said to stand on firm scientific
grounds, it is paramount to ensure that results garnered remotely are
reliable and valid. To this end, we undertook a review of the literature
and present an overview of the landscape. To date, the literature shows
evidence for the reliability of remote administration and the clinical
implications are paramount. When and where needed, neuropsychologists,
psychometric technicians and examinees may no longer need to be in the
same physical space to undergo an assessment. These findings are most
relevant given the physical distancing practices because of COVID-19.
And whilst remote assessment should never supplant face-to-face
neuropsychological assessments, it does serve as a valid alternative
when necessary.

The Novavax Heterologous COVID Booster Demonstrates Lower Reactogenicity
Than mRNA: A Targeted Review.
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
COVID-19 continues to be a global health concern and booster doses are
necessary for maintaining vaccine-mediated protection, limiting the
spread of SARS-CoV-2. Despite multiple COVID vaccine options, global
booster uptake remains low. Reactogenicity, the occurrence of adverse
local/systemic side effects, plays a crucial role in vaccine uptake and
acceptance, particularly for booster doses. We conducted a targeted
review of the reactogenicity of authorized/approved mRNA and
protein-based vaccines demonstrated by clinical trials and real-world
evidence. It was found that mRNA-based boosters show a higher incidence
and an increased severity of reactogenicity compared with the Novavax
protein-based COVID vaccine, NVX-CoV2373. In a recent NIAID study, the
incidence of pain/tenderness, swelling, erythema, fatigue/malaise,
headache, muscle pain, or fever was higher in individuals boosted with
BNT162b2 (0.4 to 41.6% absolute increase) or mRNA-1273 (5.5 to 55.0%
absolute increase) compared with NVX-CoV2373. Evidence suggests that
NVX-CoV2373, when utilized as a heterologous booster, demonstrates less
reactogenicity compared with mRNA vaccines, which, if communicated to
hesitant individuals, may strengthen booster uptake rates worldwide.

RéSUMé: OBJECTIF: La transmission de la COVID-19, l’émergence de
variants préoccupants et l’affaiblissement de l’immunité ont conduit à
recommander des doses de rappel de vaccin contre la COVID-19.
L’hésitation à la vaccination remet en question une large couverture
vaccinale. Nous avons déployé une enquête transnationale pour étudier
les connaissances, les croyances et les comportements en faveur de la
poursuite de la vaccination contre la COVID-19. MéTHODES: Nous avons
mené une enquête nationale transversale en ligne auprès d’adultes au
Canada, entre le 16 et le 26 mars 2022. Nous avons utilisé des
statistiques descriptives pour résumer notre échantillon et testé les
différences démographiques, les perceptions de l’efficacité des vaccins,
les doses recommandées et la confiance dans les décisions, en utilisant
la correction de Rao-Scott pour les tests du chi carré pondérés. La
régression logistique multivariée a été ajustée pour les covariables
pertinentes afin d’identifier les facteurs sociodémographiques et les
croyances associés à l’hésitation à la vaccination. RéSULTATS: Nous
avons collecté 2 202 questionnaires remplis. Un faible niveau
d’éducation (lycée : rapport de cotes (OR) 1,90, intervalle de confiance
(IC) à 95% 1,29, 2,81) et le fait d’avoir des enfants (OR 1,89, IC 1,39,
2,57) étaient associés à une probabilité accrue d’éprouver une
hésitation à l’égard d’une dose de rappel, tandis qu’un revenu plus
élevé (100 000 \$–149 999 \$ : OR 0,60, IC 0,39, 0,91; 150 000 \$ ou
plus : OR 0,49, IC 0,29, 0,82) était associé à une diminution des
probabilités. Incrédulité dans l’efficacité du vaccin (contre
l’infection : OR 3,69, IC 1,98, 6,90; maladie grave : OR 3,15, IC 1,69,
5,86), en désaccord avec la prise de décision du gouvernement (plutôt en
désaccord : OR 2,70, IC 1,38, 5,29; fortement en désaccord : OR 4,62, IC
2,20, 9,7) et la croyance dans le sur-vaccination (OR 2,07, IC 1,53,
2,80) ont été associées à une hésitation à recevoir une dose de rappel.
CONCLUSION: Une hésitation à l’égard du vaccin contre la COVID-19 peut
se développer ou augmenter à l’égard des vaccins ultérieurs. Nos
résultats indiquent des facteurs à prendre en compte lors du ciblage des
populations hésitantes à la vaccination.

new burn patients between March 17th, 2019, and March 17th, 2021, was
retrospectively extracted and two cohorts of patients were formed:
pre-pandemic and pandemic, through which statistical analysis was
performed. No significant changes in the number of admitted patients,
age, and sex of patients were observed. However, a significant increase
in fire/flame burns was observed during the pandemic period.
Additionally, a decrease in follow-up care was observed while an
increase in acute burn care (wound care and surgical interventions) was
found for the pandemic cohort. Despite changes to hospital care
facilities to maximize resources for COVID-19-related care, our findings
demonstrate that burn care remained an essential service and significant
reductions in patient volumes were not observed. Overall, this study
will aid in future planning and management for the provision of
pediatric burn resources during similar public health emergencies.

Bacterial infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality
worldwide. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, previous studies have
demonstrated pandemic-related shifts in the epidemiology of bacterial
bloodstream infections (BSIs) in the general population and in specific
hospital systems. Our study uses a large, comprehensive data set
stratified by setting \[community, long-term care (LTC), and hospital\]
to uniquely demonstrate how the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on BSIs
and testing practices varies by healthcare setting. We showed that,
while the number of false-positive blood culture results generally
increased during the pandemic, this effect did not apply to hospitalized
patients. We also found that many infections were likely
under-recognized in patients in the community and in LTC, demonstrating
the importance of maintaining healthcare for these groups during crises.
Last, we found a decrease in infections caused by certain pathogens in
the community, suggesting some secondary benefits of pandemic-related
public health measures.

## Final Pro Tip (optional)

You can still share the HTML document on github. You can include a link
in your `README.md` file as the following:

``` md
View [here](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/:user/:repo@:tag/:file) 
```

For example, if we wanted to add a direct link the HTML page of lecture
6, we could do something like the following:

``` md
View Week 6 Lecture [here]()
